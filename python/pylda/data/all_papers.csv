2014 BORIT VANHEE OLSEN understanding the impact of culture on cognitive trust-building processes.pdf,Understanding the impact of culture on cognitive trust-building processes: how to increase the social influence of virtual autonomous agents Melania Borit University of Troms� Troms� Norway melania.borit@uit.no Lo??s Vanhe?e LIRMM Montpellier France lois.vanhee@lirmm.fr Petter Olsen NOFIMA Troms� Norway petter.olsen@nofima.no Abstract Building fine-tuned socially believable autonomous agents interacting with humans in virtual environments is an important aspect of agent design as humans are influenced more by virtual agents with a high degree of behavioral realism. However modeling complex psychological processes such as the trust-building between humans and culturallyadaptable agents in a realistic manner is not a trivial task. When designing cultural features of intelligent agents we suggest using our model that integrates cognitive aspects of trust with culture. Certain thinking patterns are involved when a trustor evaluates the trustworthiness of a trustee and thus builds trust in him/her and finally decides whether to trust the person or not. Scientific literature describes five distinct such cognitive patterns called cognitive trust-building processes (CTBPs). Among other factors influencing how trust among parties is built such as context or personality culture shapes the preference for certain CTBPs over others (e.g. preferring to build trust by evaluating motivations over assessing ability to fulfill promised duties). National cultures can be evaluated by a combination of scores of cultural dimensions (CD) (e.g. individualism masculinity). Drawing on theories from organizational management cross-cultural psychology and social psychology our model uses CD values to calculate values for each CTBP Their order indicates the sequence in which each CTBP might be invoked. Agents would behave more realistically if they responded with trust/distrust behavior towards the user according to the agents designed cultural background and if they would display their own trustbuilding behavior according to their own designed culture. The focus of this paper is on understanding the theoretical underpinnings of the influence of culture on trust-building processes and on explaining how the results of our model can be applied in designing socially believable agents.

Norman (eds.): Proceedings of the 17th International Workshop on Trust in Agent Societies Paris France 05-MAY-2014 published at http://ceur-ws.org 1 1 Introduction According to the social influence theory of[BLB+02] humans are more likely to be influenced by a virtual entity the more they believe this entity is controlled by another human i.e. the more they believe this entity is an avatar and not a software agent. In order to increase this social influence in the context of a human interacting with an agent1 this theory further suggests increasing the agent�s visual and behavioral realism. While visual or photographic realism (i.e. the degree to which the agent resembles a human) is important in some cases but unnecessary in many others [BM13] behavioral realism seems to be the key of enhancing social influence in human agent interaction [BLB+02 BM13]. Behavioral realism is the extent to which agents behave like humans counterparts in the physical world [BLB+02]. Verbal and non-verbal behaviors are displays of the humans psychological features such as cognitive processes (e.g. perception belief awareness reasoning judgment) emotional processes or motivational ones. Given the influence of culture on human psychology and thus human behavior [Tri94 MJ12 HHM10] the research on developing agents that are culturally adaptable is growing. Until now the largest focus has been on modeling specific aspects of conversational behavior such as language [JVM05] gestures posture or proxemics [DHM+07] followed by relational behavior (i.e. the way humans perceive and treat others) such as the status one attributes to another [DHM+13] and psychological processes such as emotions [BPST07] and motivation [SA11]. Nevertheless a large palette of psychological features still has to be fine-tuned such that agents become more human-like and among these in this paper we focus on modeling the cognitive trust-building process CTBP with the aim of improving trust-building in human-agent interaction. Many factors influence these CTBPs in a human: life history personality temperament emotions propensity to trust culture etc. As for the moment no theoretical framework integrates all these factors so we chose to focus only on one of them namely on culture. People coming from different cultures form trust by involving different cognitive processes and by valuing differently the characteristics of the other party [DCM98]. National cultures can be evaluated by a specific combination of scores in at least four cultural dimensions (CDs): individualism masculinity power distance and uncertainty avoidance [HHM10]. Furthermore culture influences the preference for certain cognitive trustbuilding process over others (e.g. preferring to build trust in a trustee by evaluating his/her motivations over by assessing his/her ability to fulfill promised duties). In turn these preferences influence the importance given by the trustor to the factors of perceived trustworthiness (ability benevolence and integrity) from which to evaluate the trustworthiness of another individual. In a virtual environment there can be a wide variety of relationship types between the human (i.e. the user) and the agents. These can be neutral friendly or hostile and the relationship between the user and the agents can be fixed or it can change over time depending on the actions of the user. In human relations trust is an important aspect of most relationships and it is one that normally has the potential to change over time. Trust across cultures is particularly problematic as cultures differ significantly when it comes to how trust should be established and maintained. If person a from culture A wants person b from culture B to trust her she generally has to choose among several approaches. The most common are either act like a trustworthy person from culture A should and hope that b either recognizes this fact (b then needs to know something of culture A) or that actions inspiring trust in culture A do the same in B). Alternatively if aware of the differences between cultures A and B person a could attempt to act like a trustworthy person from culture B (as a views it) hope that b recognizes this fact and hope that b accepts that this behavior does indeed signify someone worthy of trust. Virtual environments could be symmetrical in the same way as the agent could be programmed to recognize the culture of the user based on the users avatar or behavior. In such an environment both the user and the agent can take the role of trustor and trustee as the situation demands. With the agent as (potential) trustor and the user as (potential) trustee the challenge for the user would be How do I get this agent to trust me?. With the agent as (potential) trustee and the user as (potential) trustor challenge for the user would be Can I trust this agent? (or possibly In this activity I need to trust an agent; which one out of several alternatives do I choose?). When designing cultural features of agents we propose using the results of our numerical model that integrates cognitive-trust building processes with culture. With cultural dimensions as input this model calculates appropriate values for each cognitive trust-building process. Arranged in descending order these values indicate the sequence in which each process might be invoked by individuals of specific cultures. Among possible applications this model can be used in virtual environment development by providing agents designers with the necessary guidelines for creating realistic cultural characters that behave more like humans when it comes to the issue of 1 Discussing risks cautions problems and moral aspects of social influence of agents in human-agent interaction is outside the scope of this paper. 2 building trust both as potential trustors and as potential trustees. The focus of this paper is on understanding the theoretical underpinnings of the relationship between culture and cognitive trust-building processes and on the possible application of this simple numerical model and not any experiments performed with it. We have chosen this because in interdisciplinary studies such as those bringing together social sciences psychology and computer sciences it is crucial that the theories a model builds on are understood so they are adequately captured in the mechanisms of the model. If this does not happen the model might run smoothly but its results will not reflect the realities captured by the theory or which have to be proven by it. According to existing theory humans from different cultures build trust in different ways thus different agents (e.g. German Afghan) should be designed to behave like it were building trust in this specific way and our model suggests a possible way to do this. While our model has general application potential implementation and experimentation depend on the preference of each designer on using a specific agent architecture over another and on the objective of the implementation/experimentation. The next section outlines the theoretical concepts we use in the model and its application to agents with the following one touching upon previous approaches to implement virtual agents that reflect culture through their verbal and non-verbal behavior. We then introduce the culture - trust model we developed and discuss how it can be applied in order to enhance social influence in human-agent interaction. 2 Theoretical foundation 2.1 Culture and cultural dimensions 2 The concept of culture has received many definitions and it was said that almost as many definitions of culture exist as scholars studying the phenomenon [KW88]. One of the dominant culture paradigms in business studies is the one introduced by Geert Hofstede in 1980. In his landmark study Cultures consequences: international differences in work related values it is argued that culture is the collective programming of the mind that distinguishes the members of one group or category of people from others; it includes patterns of thinking feeling and acting derived from ones social environment rather than from ones genes [HHM10]. This definition is then applied to build categories (or dimensions) of cultures. In particular investigated groups are nations and organizations. The framework introduced by Hofstede is more widely cited in the Social Science Citation Index than any other competing theories of culture and nearly all cross-cultural management studies are influenced by it [Nak09]. Despite its popularity Hofstedes approach to culture was criticized by some scholars many from outside the organizational management field. Some of the criticism refers to simplifying culture to national cultures being out-dated or having too few dimensions [HJA11 Nak09]. Nevertheless since it is considered that this paradigm superseded other culture theories [Nak09] we chose to use it ourselves in this study. In his research on cross-cultural aspects Hofstede developed the concept of cultural dimension which is a specific aspect of a culture that can be measured relative to other cultures [HHM10]. Six such cultural dimensions (CDs) have been identified: power distance (from small to large) collectivism versus individualism femininity versus masculinity uncertainty avoidance (from weak to strong) long-term versus short-term orientation and indulgence versus restraint (for reasons explained in section 4.1. we deal only with four of these dimensions). These dimensions operate together and their operation is influenced by political and economic circumstances [Hof04] and by individual personality factors [HHM10]. � Power distance (PDI): it expresses the degree to which the less powerful members of a society accept and expect that power is distributed unequally. Thus it influences the expectation and importance given to power status. In high PDI societies leaders are expected to take directions and subordinates to obey and not take initiatives. In low PDI countries the leader is just a role and subordinates are equal to their superiors. E.g. China Russia (high PDI) opposed to Scandinavian countries (low PDI). � Individualism (IDV): it influences the definition of individual identity. The lower the IDV the more one individual�s identity is linked to his/her social context (e.g. relatives colleagues). This context leads to a collective image that has to be pre-served (helping each other within the group hiding errors rejecting outsiders). Conversely in high IDV cultures individuals expect a treatment independent of any context. E.g. the U.S. Great Britain (high IDV) opposed to South American countries (low IDV). 2 Due to space limitations we cannot expand too much here on the values beliefs expectations goals emotions motives and behavior underlying cultural dimensions and cognitive trust-building processes. See [HHM10 DCM98] for a comprehensive discussion. 3 � Masculinity (MAS) (alternatively labelled achievement versus cooperation orientation [19]): it indicates preferences on assertiveness toughness performance and material success. In high MAS cultures good performance should be recognized and rewarded leading to competition. Conversely low MAS cultures favour modesty tenderness and high quality of life. Interactions focus on building cooperation and establishing consensus. E.g. Scandinavian countries (low MAS) versus Japan Hungary (high MAS). � Uncertainty avoidance (UAI): it favors the desire for clear and explicit situations with predictable outcomes. In high UAI cultures this desire leads to establishment of rules (formal or not) making everything explicit with low ambiguity. Conversely individuals with low UAI culture dislike the presence of rules. They tend to accept more easily situations with unspecified behavior or unclear outcome. E.g. Greece Portugal (high UAI) versus Denmark Vietnam (low UAI). Partly based on replications and extensions of an IBM survey conducted between 1967 and 1973 the latest database of cultural dimensions values contains scores for 73 countries and three regions [The12]. These values are national averages which represent the type of behaviors individuals are more likely to perform in a country than in another. These values obviously do not mean that every individual in a given country will perform differently than in another one. 2.2 Trust Trust has been defined in many different ways by different scientific domains. Only in the period 1960 1990 areas such as management marketing psychology and sociology employed more than 70 definitions of trust [CF10]. However one of the most influential definition is the one proposed by Mayer Davis and Schoorman in 1995: trust (noun) is the willingness of a party (trustor) to be vulnerable to the actions of another party (trustee/target) based on the expectation that the other will perform a particular action important to the trustor irrespective of the ability to monitor or control that other party. 2.3 Trustworthiness and perceived trustworthiness The best device for creating trust is to establish and support trustworthiness [Har04] and many authors have theorized why a party will be judged as trustworthy. If to trust is a concept linked with the trustor then to be trusted (passive form of to trust) to be trustworthy and trustworthiness are concepts linked with the trustee. Trustworthy (adj.) is defined as worthy of being trusted (www.thefreedictionary.com) while trustworthiness (n.) is considered to be the personal state or quality of being trustworthy (www.thefreedictionary.com). Connecting this last definition with the one of trust we can say that trustworthiness is the trustees personal quality of being worthy to be invested with the willingness of a trustor to be vulnerable to the actions of the trustee (based on the expectation that the trustee will perform a particular action important to the trustor irrespective of the ability to monitor or control the trustee). This quality is not a general truth an absolute term about the trustee but a relative one connected to the trustors perception of the trustee. This means that while a target can be judged as trustworthy by a trustor another trustor might consider the same target as untrustworthy. [MDS95] describe three conditions that can give a trustee this quality of trustworthiness in the eyes of a trustor: his/her displayed ability benevolence and/or integrity (ABI). They frame these conditions within the concept of factors of perceived trustworthiness (FPTs) defined as unique perceptual perspectives from which to consider the trustee. � Ability: it represents the perception of the trustor over a group of skills competences and characteristics that enable a party (the trustee) to perform in a specific domain (e.g. a patient trusts a certain neurosurgeon well known for her skills for a complicated brain operation). � Benevolence: it is the trustees perceived altruism his/her disposition to be genuinely interested in the trustors welfare even at his/her own expense (e.g. a young couple accepts the loan requirements from a bank known to help young people seeking to start a family). � Integrity: it is the trustor�s perception of the trustees faithfulness to a set of principles that the trustor finds acceptable (e.g. a firm starts doing business with another firm that is known for its business integrity; dealing with Swiss banks might be an obvious example here). 4 2.4 Cognitive trust-building processes Some authors consider that trust can be thought of as a continuous mono-dimensional space with trust and distrust as its two extremes [GV10 CE03] theorize that trust develops via a dynamic process that has three evolutionary phases. In the beginning of the relationship if there is a total lack of information about the trustworthiness of the other trust starts theoretically around the zero point (the trustor is not willing to make himself/herself vulnerable to the actions of the other party)3. During the building-trust phase the trustor engages in actions meant to acquire knowledge about the trustworthiness of the target (his/her ability benevolence and/or integrity) while the trustee engages in actions meant to prove his/her trustworthiness. Thus over time if these trust-building actions are successful the general level of trust grows until it begins to level off during the maintenance phase and then stays relatively constant. If during this second stage a trust-destroying event occurs the overall level of trust drops quickly to the level of distrust and even more intense trust-building actions on behalf of the trustee are required to raise trustors trust from this level. Our culture - trust model deals only with the first phase of this process (i.e. the trust-building one) as it attempts to identify what cognitive processes the trustor is using when evaluating the trustworthiness of the trustee. During the trust-building phase certain thinking patterns are involved when the trustor evaluates the trustworthiness of the trustee and thus builds trust in him/her. According to [DC97] trust building relies on the formation of a trustor�s expectations about the motives and behaviors of a trustee [DC97]. Scientific literature describes five distinct cognitive patterns which can be employed by the trustor when forming such expectations: calculative capability prediction intentionality and transference [DCM98]. These cognitive patterns are called cognitive trust building processes (CTBPs). � Calculative: this process engages the trustor in evaluating the costs and/or rewards of the trustee cheating or staying in the relationship and if the benefits of cheating do not exceed the costs of being caught the trustor infers that it would be contrary to the trustee�s best interest to cheat and therefore the trustee can be trusted. E.g. a research lab wants to collaborate with a competing lab for analyzing a complex chemical. The costs and benefits of the competing lab are analyzed and if the benefits of cheating (patenting the results as own only research) do not exceed the costs of being caught the competing lab will be trusted in order to be taken in as a partner. � Prediction: this process engages the trustor in analyzing the trustees behavior in order to decide whether it is consistent or not. E.g. students trust a teacher to be fair with them in the third year of their bachelor degree because they recollect this teacher always being fair since they entered university. � Intentionality: this process engages the trustor to estimate trustees motivation. E.g. when asked by the leader of the department to undergo a certain evaluation process the employee trusts the leader to do so because he/she thinks the leader is interested in the employees personal development and not in the profit of the firm performing the evaluation. � Capability: this process engages the trustor to analyse the trustees ability to act. E.g. in an amusement park the users of the roller-coaster evaluate the technical competences of the staff serving the facilities to run the roller-coaster in safety conditions. � Transference: this process engages the trustor in transferring trust from a known entity (proof source) to an unknown one. The proof source can be a person (e.g. friends family) or an institution (e.g. the government). E.g. the government advices citizens to use a certain bank for specific transactions abroad. Citizens highly trust the government therefore they will use the services of this particular bank. In practice these CTBPs are interrelated as some factors can invoke multiple CTBPs (e.g. frequent contact with a target may activate both the prediction process and the intentionality one) [DCM98]. Therefore the evaluation of a trustees trustworthiness may be influenced by several CTBPs which are often combined and invoked in an unconscious sequenced preference [SSD+10] and triggered sometimes by the same stimulus. 3 Theory also mentions that the general willingness to trust others (i.e propensity to trust) differs from person to person [MDS95]. Thus regardless their mental pathway of building trust some people are more likely to trust others while some are not. This propensity is also influenced by culture [SMD07] 5 2.5 Linking trust-building processes with factors of perceived trustworthiness There is a clear link between how CTBPs manifest themselves and how FPTs are integrated within these processes and this link has an influence over the behavior of both the trustor and the trustee. As said above the trustor engages in actions meant to acquire knowledge about the trustworthiness of the target while the trustee engages in actions meant to prove his/her trustworthiness. On the one hand while acquiring knowledge about the trustworthiness of the target the trustor will engage in one or more cognitive CTBPs [DCM98]. When engaged in this activity the trustor will assess the three FPTs of the target from the perspective of the cognitive process he/she uses. For example if the trustor is using the intentionality CTBP he/she will look for benevolence signs in the targets behavior while if the trustor is using the capability CTBP he/she will assess the targets ability [DCM98]. Or yet another example while engaged in the prediction CTBP the trustor will look at the consistency of the targets past actions or at the extent to which the targets actions are congruent with his/her words [DCM98]. These issues as well as past actions consistency and actions-words congruency significantly affect the degree to which a party is judged to have integrity [MDS95]. On the other hand the trustee can choose to display one characteristic or another (e.g. ability benevolence or integrity) in order to be perceived as trustworthy by the trustor appreciating more that FPT because of the CTBP he/she employs. For in-stance trust formed via the capability CTBP is based on the trustee being evaluated as able to fulfill his/her promises. Thus trust is established when the trustor perceives that the trustee has the necessary skills and competences. This suggests at least one strategy for trustees seeking to form trust based on a capability TBP. They can for example increase their perceived abilities by revealing the number of experts hired for performing the specific action the trustor trusts them to accomplish. 2.6 Linking trust with culture Many scholars consider that among other matters such as affect and emotion culture impacts trust building through the perceived trustworthiness of a trustee [Hof04 HHM10 MDS95]. For example more performance oriented societies (high MAS) tend to place a higher value on the ability variable of the ABI framework while the feminine cultures (low MAS) tend to emphasize more the benevolence variable [SMD07]. The most straightforward connection between trust and culture is done by [DCM98]. These authors describe how national culture through relation to risk (UAI) authority (PDI) and self (MAS IDV) impacts TBPs. Based on the idea that the values guiding peoples behavior influence trust building process the authors formulated 15 propositions about how cultural dimensions facilitate or inhibit the application of CTBPs. For example one such proposition states that in low UAI cultures trustors are more likely to form trust via a calculative process. 3 Social influence in virtual environments: related work Humans have certain expectations about communicative signals patterns and reactions of interaction partners [SA11]. Such expectations have a crucial influence on how humans unconsciously choose different cognitive pathways of building trust in others [DCM98]. According to the social influence theory humans are influenced more by virtual agents with a high degree of behavioral realism ([BLB+02 BM13 MdCG13]. Believability of an agent means that humans can apply their usual mental models of communication when interacting with the agent ([SA11]). Thus the agent is expected to behave as humans would do in a given situation both in its own initiated behavior and the one generated as a response to the user. This is essential for behavioral realism and thus social influence if an agent looks like a human (or is supposed to represent a human) people expect it to behave like one as well and will be disturbed by or misinterpret discrepancies from human norms [MWR03 NIL00]. Nevertheless the appearance and behavior of these characters is in most cases based on the cultural background of their designers [KED+12]. Thus there is the risk that characters developed for a particular culture might not find acceptance when being presented to another culture [KED+12]. Even though a few attempts have been made to create agents that reflect a particular cultural background interaction with these characters still remains an awkward experience in particular when it comes to non-verbal interaction. As a consequence agents might not be accepted and their social influence will be minimal when interacting in a culturally inappropriate manner [KED+12]. Adapting an agent to a different culture involves not only the obvious language translation but also the careful reconsideration of each of the key characteristics identified in the literature: identity backstory appearance content of speech manner of speaking manner of gesturing emotional dynamics social interaction patterns role and role dynamics [SMK+11]. However usually cultural/social adaptation of agents has focused on visual ele6 ments relating to non-verbal behaviors especially gesture facial expression and inter-personal distance [AVA+09] or on linking only verbal behavior to emotion/motivation/trust/culture (i.e. verbal/non-verbal cues ? psychological features/culture) and not so much on the verbal/non-verbal manifestation of cognitive processes in a specific cultural setting (i.e. culture ? psychological features ? verbal/non-verbal display). For example see the research of [AVA+09 DHM+13 DHM+07 HRMM02 IC07 MHR00 MDA+09 OB97 DPP04 SMK+11 TR09] for culture [HJA11] for culture and emotions; [BPST07 MWR03 NIL00] for emotions [SA11] for motivation [BC01 CS03 MAM97] for trustworthiness of human-like agents and [DLP13] for building social identity of these agents. While personality relates to the level of the individual culture relates to social groups and it is not enough to modify the expressive behavior of the individual character; they must also be considered as social actors and behave in a socially acceptable manner[AVA+09]. Even as each human personality is unique each culture tends to evoke specific modes of adjustment and reactions in different situations[SMK+11]. 4 Designing realistic cultural agents in relation to cognitive trust-building processes 4.1 Modeling trust-building cognitive processes according to cultural background In attempting to link culture with trust in a quantitative way our model draws on the qualitative links between cultural dimensions and cognitive trust-building processes described by [DCM98]. According to the qualitative assessment of these authors high and low CD values have positive influences on different CTBP. Moreover the same type of culture (low IDV/MAS/PDI high UAI) influences similarly the CTBPs of intentionality and transference while the opposite of this type of culture (high IDV/MAS/PDI low UAI) influences the calculative CTBP. Doney et al. acknowledge that their research provides insight into the implications of trust developed by alternative processes without specifying a hierarchical approach. Furthermore they assume that each dimension of culture is of equal importance. Thus following their reasoning we also explicitly assume that each cultural dimension has the same weight in the process of trust building (i.e. we transform the qualitative links of [DCM98] in linear formula assuming that each cultural dimension has an independent and equal impact on the importance given to a TBP). However we are aware that it may be that trustors assign greater weight to trust developed via one cognitive process compared to another and that context may influence the relevance of a particular cultural dimension. Based on further theoretical and empirical studies our model may be modified in order to reflect these by using other methods for computing the formula for TBPs (e.g. maximum amongst positive cultural dimensions mean of positive links squared cultural dimensions scores). Nevertheless for the moment as indicated by [DCM98] questions regarding whether or how trustors prioritize these TBP remain unanswered. Because [DCM98] used only four cultural dimensions our model uses only four too. We first normalized each cultural dimension in a [-1;1] space where -1 corresponds to the lowest cultural value and 1 to the highest one by using the following formula: n valueCD(c) = valueCD(c)?minCD maxCD ?minCD � 2? 1 Where n valueCD(c) is the normalized value of the country c in the cultural dimension CD valueCD is the normalized value of c in CD minCD and maxCD are respectively the minimal and maximal values of this cultural dimension. With this representation a country with a low value for a cultural dimension has a value below 0 and above 0 otherwise the maximal value is 1 and the minimal is ?1. This normalization preserves the distance ratios between the cultural dimensions of various countries. Using this scale we evaluate the importance given to each CTBP in using the following formula: valueCalc(c) = n valueIDV (c) + n valueMAS(c) + n valuePDI(c)? n valueUAI(c) (1) valuePred(c) = ?n valueIDV (c)? n valueMAS(c) + n valuePDI(c) + n valueUAI(c) (2) valueCapa(c) = n valueIDV (c) + n valueMAS(c) + n valuePDI(c) + n valueUAI(c) (3) valueInt(c) = ?n valueIDV (c)? n valueMAS(c)? n valuePDI(c) + n valueUAI(c) (4) valueTrans(c) = ?n valueIDV (c)? n valueMAS(c)? n valuePDI(c) + n valueUAI(c) (5) Where valueCalc is the importance given to the calculative TBP valuePred is the importance given to the predictive TBP valueCapa is the importance given to the capability TBP valueInt is the importance given to 7 Figure 1: Countries and their respective pairs of the first two cognitive trust-building processes as calculated using our culture-trust model the intentionality TBP valueTrans is the importance given to the transference TBP. Each formula corresponds to the linear combination of the positive relations between high/low values of cultural dimensions and CTBPs given by [DCM98]. Following the recommendations from [CF10] to look closer at cognitive models of trust our model focuses on how trust building (from a cognitive perspective) and culture might interact and what could be the outcome of this interaction. At the same time one has to keep in mind that this is a formalization of the first phase of the trust process only (see Section 2.4) and cannot answer the question of how trust will evolve. For example if a trustor used the transference process in this first phase the target might need to maintain trust via another CTBP to ensure the completion of the second phase [DCM98]. When fed with the values of the national cultural dimensions calculated by Hofstede our culture - trust model calculates appropriate values for each trust-building cognitive process. Arranged in descending order these values indicate the sequence in which each CTBP might be invoked by individuals of specific cultures. The data-map displayed in Figure 1 presents for the sake of visualization clarity only pairs of the first two trust building processes as calculated using our model. A table with all the data calculated for all trust-building processes for all the countries for which cultural dimensions values are available can be provided at request. The results obtained by this model are coherent with former theoretical descriptions of how people from different cultures build trust from [Hof04 HHM10] and [SMD07]. For example [SMD07] state that more collaborative being oriented feminine (thus low MAS) cultures tend to put more emphasis on the benevolence variable. Hence for people in these cultures trust emerges if the trustor perceives target to be genuinely interested in the trustors welfare and motivated to seek joint gain. This way of building trust is specific to the intentionality process [DCM98]. According to our formalization nine of the most feminine cultures rank the intentionality/transference process first. Moreover these results seem to be consistent with indirect descriptions of the trust-building phase found in empirical case-studies [CE03 Ide09]. Furthermore there is a statistically significant relationship between these results and values of CTBPs proxy indicators taken from available world-wide surveys (Borit and Vanhe?e work under progress). This model can be used to infer the CTBP sequence for any individual given that the scores of this individual for the four CDs are known. Applications that calculate these scores are already available on the market (e.g. CultureGPS or ComPass). 4.2 Consequences for agents design When designing agents our culture-trust model can be used from a double perspective: 1) considering the user as a trustor (with the agent as a trustee) and 2) considering the user as a trustee (with the agent as a trustor). In the first case users would have to consider the trustworthiness of the agent. In order for the user to trust the agent the way the user would trust a human in the role that the agent plays the agent would have to manifest the characteristic signs of the cognitive trust-building processes that a human would invoke in the respective situation given the culture of that human. For example an agent designed to exhibit Nigerian trustbuilding traits guiding the user through the mountains would have to display characteristics of the prediction and 8 intentionality/transference CTBPs (e.g. performing certain rituals revealing its benevolent actions) in order for the user to trust it (if the user has a certain degree of cultural awareness). If the agent would display the characteristics of capability and calculative CTBPs (e.g. talking about its expertise in guiding) then this behavior would mirror a North-American way of thinking which would be in discrepancy with the cultural background it is designed to represent. Instructional role-play simulations like the ones developed by Alelo Inc.[Ale14] provide dos and dont�s in intercultural encounters. By trial and error the user learns about the practices (rituals symbols) of specific cultures (the answers to the what and how questions when meeting a new culture). Nevertheless the simulation does not provide the user with the underlying cognitive premises of the agent behavior (the why question). For example the simulation teaches the user that she/he has to ask the agent designed to exhibit Taiwanese cultural traits about how the dinner was prepared and provide compliments to build rapport but it does not offer the explanation that actually this is an action meant to build trust according to the prediction and intentionality/transference CTBPs that are usually firstly invoked by the Taiwanese humans. When the user understands the connection between the agent behavior and the specific way this agent trusts people the user can handle different kinds of situations than the one explicit in the simulation (for example how to behave when convincing a Taiwanese human/agent to join him/her to a party not only how to behave at dinner). In the second case the agent would have to evaluate the actions of the user and decide whether to trust him/her or not. In the same example if the user is North-American then he/she is more likely to invoke the capability and calculative CTBPs and be more task-oriented than the virtual counterpart. In this case the user would not engage in trying to know the agent on a more personal basis (e.g. not trying to build a personal relationship by asking different questions about the general wellbeing of the agent and of its family) but would ask directly for expert services. Having a different cognitive pattern of building trust in order to behave realistically the agent should display a non-trusting behavior until the player changes his/her strategy. From these two perspectives our model could be included in the further development of other intercultural training tools such as Traveller [DHM+13] TLTS [JVM05] ELECT BiLAT [HBL+06] or ORIENT [AVA+09]. 4.3 Possible other applications in a multiagent systems context Our formalization could be used in order to replicate the development of trust in the context of artificial societies influenced by their cultures. In particular this model might be used in multi-agent systems at the agent level in order to reproduce the impact of culture on multi-agent interactions. For example it could be included in contemporary trust models in order to give them a cultural setting and then observe different outcomes influenced by this cultural setting. That fact that the modeler can simulate the cognitive trust building processes of an agent in a realistic manner could be a powerful tool. Additionally BDI agents that are capable of abducing other agent�s intentions (intentionality CTBP) and behavior (prediction CTBP) could be designed using this model. The impact of trust has a clearly observable importance in organizations. [D�I94] illustrates how three very similar organizations under the influence of different cultures establish trust in a different way. They may rely on a) honour attaching individuals to a status and making them responsible for defending it; b) contracts binding individuals to a performance measure; or c) consensus integrating concerned individuals by decision making creating a cooperation spirit [D�I94]. Each form of organization can be linked to at least one trust building process: honour with prediction and calculative contract with calculative and capability and consensus with intentionality. Agent-based models of culture and organizations (as described in [VDF13]) would benefit from including the importance of trust in organizations and the influence of culture on it through integrating our formalization. Among others these models could show different organizational dynamics based on how trust between the agents is build according to their cultural background. Moreover organizations can display a large panel of behaviors which might inspire trust through different TBPs. To this extent organizations could specialize in certain types of trustworthiness display aiming at different targets. For instance consider an organization favoring costumer service (benevolence through the prediction and intentionality TBPs) while another proposes quality (ability through the capability TBP). Our formalization could be used to analyze crucial changes an organization has to make in order to fit a given market. In addition simulating several organizations in a multi-cultural setting could show what type of national market niches can appear. 9 5 Conclusions and future work People coming from different cultures form trust by involving different cognitive processes and by valuing differently the characteristics of the other party [DCM98]. In line with the research related to including cognitive processes (e.g. trust building) emotions motivations and culture in the agents design we propose integrating trust and culture theories in the design of agents as a way to enhance their social believability and thus their social influence in a human-agent interaction context. When designing the cognitive characteristics of agents we propose considering also the trust-building cognitive aspect and suggest using the results of a culture trust model we have built. This numerical model integrates CTBPs with culture: having as input cultural dimensions values the model calculates appropriate values for each CTBP. These values indicate the sequence in which each CTBP might be invoked thus providing agents designers with guidelines of creating cultural characters that are believable when it comes to how they build trust. Agents could be able to behave more realistically when displaying themselves trustworthy behavior and responding with trust or distrust in the player according to its cultural background. The focus of this paper is on understanding the theoretical underpinnings of the relationship between culture and trust and on explaining how the results of our model can be applied in designing agents in order to improve trust-building in human-agent interaction. As future work with direct application on modeling the trust-building relationship between humans and agents we intend to create correspondence rules that connect CTBPs to concrete specifications of conversational behavior (e.g. language gesture expressivity posture or proxemics) appearance content of speech emotional dynamics social interaction patterns role and role dynamics. Also since our culture - trust model deals only with the first phase of the trust cognitive process we intend to look closer into the time - CTBPs and destroyed trust CTBPs relationships an approach that has also direct application in the area of enhancing social believability of agents (e.g. the user might meet the same agent several times during the game; how should the agent maintain trust over time? How should the agent behave if the user behaves in a trust-destroying manner?).

Implementing traceability systems across the food supply chain is seen as crucial for increasing food quality and safety for optimizing production or for documenting sustainability. However implementation of traceability systems in the seafood sector seems to be stagnating. Against this backdrop the main objective of this study is to define and analyse in detail seafood traceability benefits related to regulatory compliance supply chain management improvements market access facilitation and risk mitigation. To support this objective the study collects and compiles policy incentives from governments and industry associations to encourage the establishment of company seafood traceability. In addition this study updates information regarding existing traceability standards and norms serving various purposes in the seafood sector. Based on a thorough analysis of speciality literature and the extensive experience of the authors this study formulates several recommendations that are relevant for a wide range of stakeholders in the seafood sector.  v CONTENTS Preparation of this document .................................................................................................................. iii Abstract .................................................................................................................................................. iv Abbreviations and acronyms ................................................................................................................. vii Executive summary ................................................................................................................................ ix  1.

As a first step in reaching these objectives the publication explains the key terms in understanding the concept of traceability (e.g. granularity transformation and referential integrity etc.). Moreover the concept of traceability is described in connection with related notions (traceability systems and their elements analytical methods etc.). In a second step existing various seafood traceability standards and norms are briefly described with a focus on the latest developments in the respective areas. Based on a systematic literature review the next step consists in defining and analysing traceability benefits with success cases being described in connection with these benefits. In a final step a rapid literature review is employed to identify incentives to encourage the establishment of company seafood traceability.  This process yields the following results and recommendations:  1. There is still a lack of knowledge about the benefits of introducing a traceability system among the actors in seafood supply chains. Communicating and understanding the benefits of a traceability system are important for successful implementation of traceability. Interested agencies should fund awareness-raising campaigns in order to spread the knowledge about these diverse benefits and their implications for value creation. 2. There are cultural differences in benefits perceived by different groups of stakeholders. At the same time risk communication is more effective if it is adapted to the culture of the audience. Thus interested agencies should adapt the communication strategy of the benefits of traceability raising awareness campaign to the cultural specificities of the audience. 3. Organizations can extract significant value from implementing traceability and extend from a �must do� to comply with regulatory requirements to a �must have� to differentiate their products in the marketplace. The communication strategy of traceability benefits has to include an awareness-raising campaign that focuses specifically on the value creation potential of traceability systems. 4. Besides the lack of knowledge about the benefits of traceability among the actors in seafood supply chains there is also the need for more cost�benefits studies to be communicated to possible stakeholders. Interested agencies should commission such cost�benefit studies and disseminate the results widely. 5. Traceability success stories/cases are little documented especially for developing countries. Interested agencies should commission studies of such success stories with specific requirements of what has to be recorded in a structured and systematic way in terms of traceability incentives drivers and benefits. 6. In general food businesses are not motivated to implement new standards for information exchange and traceability as they perceive this as an additional cost and are not aware of the associated benefits. In addition companies are not willing to make changes to their current operational practices. Similarly companies are also concerned about data security and are not willing to share sensitive information unless it is protected in trusted repositories but this issue is secondary to their reluctance to change their current practices. Interested agencies should x commission a study of the motivations for adopting traceability systems that also explore possible solutions to the concerns raised by food businesses. 7. There is still a lack of understanding about what kind of perceptions can influence the internal attitudes and motivations of the firm to implement a traceability system. Interested agencies should commission a study of the reasons for not adopting traceability systems. 8. Extrinsic incentives were found to be stronger than intrinsic and social incentives. As such extrinsic incentives could be recommended to businesses government and social entities for a better implementation of traceability systems in the respective supply chain. 9. Policy targeted at providing firms with incentives to establish efficient recall systems will be less costly to firms and consumers and better targeted than policy mandating traceability. Usually performance standards � rather than process standards � ensure the most efficient compliance systems. Governments and industry associations should focus on formulating policies targeted at providing firms with incentives to establish efficient actions such as recalls. In the example of more efficient recalls such policies include the following: recall and other food safety performance standards; any policy that increases the likelihood that producers of unsafe food will be identified and punished; and any policy that increases the punishment for producing and selling unsafe foods. 10. Regulatory interventions do not drive the technological evolution of food traceability systems. Interested agencies should commission a study about the drivers of implementing traceability systems to complement this study on benefits and incentives. 11. Contrary to popular belief traceability is not a method to ensure that information about a certain product is true or accurate; traceability systems contain claims about the food product in question and these claims may or may not be true. Some of these claims are related to chemical physical or sensory attributes of the food and these claims can (to some degree of accuracy at least) be tested by analytical methods such as DNA-based analyses or nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Interested agencies should commission studies specifically focused on data validation and verification of any types of claims in order to avoid the �garbage in garbage out� problem and thus to increase the value of traceability systems. 12. It has been noted that adoption of safety standards may promote power imbalances lack of trust and transparency and the easing of minimalistic strategies in dealing with food safety. Thus when adopting such standards governments and industry associations should implement initiatives to counterbalance such developments. For example strategies to avoid exclusion include: (i) providing ample education and training to overcome human capital constraints; (ii) fostering the development of the institutional infrastructure necessary to support implementation of traceability systems within a developing-country environment; and (iii) encouraging the participation of producers associations or cooperatives to provide a critical mass in terms of supply provide a conduit for the dissemination of information on benefits of traceability to smallholders and improve the bargaining power of individual farmers/fishers vis-�-vis larger retailers or processors. 13. Companies across the supply chain should consider adopting industry-wide use of the standards using globally unique identification of units as a significant step forward for electronic and interoperable seafood traceability. If using a globally unique unite code such as the Serial Global Trade Item Number rather than the Lot Global Trade Item Number code an example of such standard is the Global Dialogue for Seafood Traceability Standards and Guidelines for Interoperable Seafood Traceability Systems Version 1.0. These industry-developed standards are designed to improve the reliability of seafood information reduce the cost of traceability contribute to supply chain risk reduction and contribute to securing the long-term social and environmental sustainability of the sector.  Underlying many of these recommendations is the fact that what the society needs and what the consumer prefers is full chain traceability from vessel or aquaculture site to plate. What companies tend to focus on is their own internal traceability largely limited to inputs (raw materials and ingredients) and outputs (products) from their own processes. This difference in perspective has many ramifications in particular related to the need for unit identification. The traceability systems in most seafood companies are batch-based and this identification principle is also the basis for most standards xi and good practice recommendations in this area. If the focus is internal traceability batch-based identification is fine because all units (boxes and cases) from the same batch have the same properties and it makes sense to identify them in the same way. However if the focus is full chain traceability batch-based identification is not a good solution. The reason is that the units in question (the units coming from the same production batch) can only be said to have the same properties when they are physically kept together. In practice in the seafood industry the units from a production batch (a cage a day�s slaughter a catch or a day�s processing) are not kept together throughout the chain. A production batch is often split up and different units from the same batch may be transported using different vehicles to the same or to different destinations. Once they arrive if the only available identifier is the batch identifier it is impossible to say what means of transportation was used what the unit location was at a given time or what the temperature was at a given time. Often other identifiers are temporarily affixed to the units as when a unit is part of a pallet and the pallet has a globally unique identifier. However it is not uncommon that the link to these additional identifiers is lost (e.g. when the pallet wrapping is discarded) so that the batch identifier is the only one that remains when the unit reaches its destination. While this can be used to access information related to the process that produced it it cannot be used to access information about what happened subsequently and so it is not a good solution for full chain traceability.  Thus a final recommendation and one that underlies and supports many of the recommendations above is:  14. To achieve full chain traceability a shift in perspective is needed from a focus on documenting inputs and outputs to specific processes there and then to a focus on the ability to document all properties relating to the product or unit anywhere in the supply chain including origin process history location and any other attributes that might be relevant. For this batch identification is not sufficient and unique unit identification is needed. Interested agencies should commission studies that highlight the benefits of full chain traceability as opposed to internal traceability and in particular document the value of and benefits related to unique identification of units compared with batch-based identification of units.   1 1. INTRODUCTION This report was commissioned by FAO�s Fisheries and Aquaculture Department to:  ? update information regarding existing traceability standards and norms serving various purposes in the seafood sector including international standards/guidelines regulatory standards and nonregulatory standards; ? define and analyse in detail seafood traceability benefits related to regulatory compliance supply chain management improvements market access facilitation and risk mitigation and present one or two success cases including some from developing countries under each category or subcategory of benefits; ? collect and compile policy incentives from governments and industry associations to encourage the establishment of company (corporate and micro small and medium-sized enterprise [MSMEs]) seafood traceability.  Following an outline of the methodology (Chapter 2) and as a first step towards reaching these objectives Chapter 3 explains the key terms in understanding the concept of traceability (e.g. granularity transformations referential integrity etc.). Moreover the concept of traceability is described in connection with related notions (e.g. traceability systems and their elements analytical methods etc.). In a second step Chapter 4 provides a brief description of existing various seafood traceability standards and norms with a focus on the latest developments in the respective areas. Based on a systematic literature review Chapter 5 then defines and analyses traceability benefits with success cases being described in connection with these benefits. In a final step a rapid literature review is employed to identify incentives to encourage the establishment of company seafood traceability (Chapter 6). Chapter 7 presents the recommendations.  2 2. METHODOLOGY 2.1. General considerations This study employed a multi-methods approach that involved the following steps:  1. Conceptualization of key terms (Chapter 3). 2. General description of existing traceability standards and norms serving various purposes in seafood sector including international standards and guidelines regulatory standards and nonregulatory standards with a focus on the latest developments in the respective areas based on document analysis (Chapter 4). 3. Detailed analysis of seafood traceability benefits including success cases based on a systematic literature review (Chapter 5). 4. Collection and compilation of policy incentives from governments and industry associations to encourage the establishment of company (corporate and MSMEs) seafood traceability based on a rapid literature review (Chapter 6).  2.2. Systematic literature review A systematic literature review (Grant and Booth 2009) was performed in order to identify scientific studies analysing the benefits of seafood traceability. The database used for search was ScienceDirect. The search was conducted in all fields up to 23 October 2019 within the following article types: research articles book chapters conference abstracts and short communications. Two concepts were used to structure the search query including: benefits and seafood traceability (search string: benefit* AND �seafood traceability�). No limits were placed on year of publication. Studies were initially screened for relevance to the review topic. Records were excluded if they did not specifically investigate or refer to benefits of seafood traceability or if access to them was restricted. The records identified through this technique were supplemented through: (i) snowball sampling of relevant sources based on the results of the first screening; (ii) a second search with the same input but using the search string: benefit* AND �food traceability�; and (iii) snowball sampling of relevant sources based on the results of the second search. Figure 1 summarizes the screening process.  2.3. Rapid literature review A rapid literature review (Grant and Booth 2009) was performed in order to identify policy incentives from governments and industry associations to encourage establishment of company seafood traceability. The database used for the search was Google Scholar and the search was conducted up to 23 October 2019. The search string used was: policy AND incentives AND food AND traceability.  2.4. Document analysis Document analysis is a systematic procedure for reviewing or evaluating documents and it requires that requires that data be examined and interpreted in order to elicit meaning gain understanding and develop empirical knowledge (Bowen 2009). This analytic procedure entails finding selecting appraising (making sense of) and synthesizing data contained in documents (Bowen 2009). The technique of coding has been used in this study (Kawulich 2004) following a coding scheme developed based on the objectives of the study. In order to ensure reliability of results one rater performed the analysis.   3 Figure 1.

THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK 3.1. Traceability concept terms and definitions The following constitutes a short but by no means exhaustive primer on traceability terms and concepts. For some of these terms where there are conflicting or ambiguous views or descriptions the definitions most consistent with normal practice in the seafood industry as indicated in key industry documents and standards have been selected. The definitions and explanations are taken from works by the authors of the present document (Borit and Olsen 2016; Olsen and Borit 2018).  Table 1. Definitions and explanations of terms and concepts used in this study Concept (in alphabetical order)  Definition or explanation Attribute The characteristic or distinguishing feature of a product. For more details see Olsen and Borit (2018). Batch The quantity of material prepared or required for one operation. In seafood supply chains reference is commonly made to raw material batches (the fish component) ingredient batches (other components) and production batches. Batch is an internal term in the company; batch identifiers are often locally generated in the company and do not normally adhere to any standards. Batches are not necessarily explicitly labelled or identified in the company as long as the company knows what constitutes a given batch. Chain traceability Chain traceability is the traceability between links in a supply chain (companies) and it depends on the data recorded in the internal traceability system being transmitted and then read and understood in the next link in the chain Drivers Determinants that lead firms to decide how to allocate their financial resources in implementing different levels of voluntary traceability; a motivating factor. For a summary of traceability drivers see Borit and Olsen (2016). Granularity Granularity refers to the amount of product referred to by the traceable resource unit (TRU) identifier. Granularity depends on the physical size of the TRU; the smaller the TRU the smaller the granularity. When implementing a traceability system companies have to make a decision on the granularity they want. A fish processing company can typically choose whether it assigns a new production batch number every day every shift (e.g. 2�3 times per day) or every time it changes raw materials (e.g. 1�20 times per day). The lower the granularity the more TRUs the company will have the more work will be involved and the more accurate the traceability system will be. Granularity can be a particularly important consideration when planning for potential product recalls; the larger the granularity the more products will have to be recalled if anything goes wrong. Identifier uniqueness Traceable resource units (TRUs) are given identifiers in the form of numeric or alphanumeric codes. These identifiers are either assigned by the company that generates the TRU or they are mutually agreed between trading partners often with reference to standards. For an identifier to serve as intended it must be unique within the context where it is used. The context can be the individual production facility the parent company the supply chain nationally or globally. For further details see Olsen and Borit (2018). Internal traceability Internal traceability is the traceability within a link or a company. Interoperability The ability of different information technology systems or software programs to communicate seamlessly for the purpose of exchanging and using data. For systems to be truly interoperable they must have both semantic (common meaning) and syntactic (common format) interoperability (Hardt Flett and Howell 2017). Traceability The ability to access any or all information relating to that which is under consideration throughout its entire life cycle by means of recorded identifications. Traceable resource unit This study refers to �that which is under consideration� in the traceability definition as a TRU. For more details see Olsen and Borit (2018). 5 Concept (in alphabetical order)  Definition or explanation Trade unit Trade unit (or trade item) is a quantity of material (e.g. fish product) that is sold by one trading partner to another trading partner. Incoming trade units are often merged or mixed into raw material or ingredient batches e.g. when captured fish is sorted by size and quality before processing. Production batches are typically large (everything produced of one product type in one unit of time typically a day or a shift is common practice for production batches) and are normally split into numerous outgoing trade units. Transformation Generation of a new TRU based on existing TRU. Typical transformation types are merges splits and mixes. Sources: Based on Borit and Olsen 2016 and Olsen and Borit 2018.  3.2. Traceability systems Traceability systems are constructions that enable traceability; they can be paper-based they can be computer-based or they can be a combination of the two. The components of a traceability system are as follows (Olsen and Borit 2018):  1. a mechanism for identifying traceable resource units (TRUs); 2. a mechanism for documenting transformations i.e. connections between TRUs. 3. a mechanism for recording the attributes of the TRUs.  As explained in Olsen and Borit (2018) when deciding how to identify TRUs there is a need to: choose the identifier code type and structure; make choices with respect to granularity and uniqueness of the code; and find a way to associate the identifier with the TRU in question. Once the selection of the type of identifier to use has been made and a way to associate the identifier to the TRU has been found it is necessary to document what happens to the TRU as it moves through the supply chain. Thus a direct or indirect record of transformations of the TRU has to be established as does the ability to document the sequence of transformations as one of the most important functions of the traceability system. Some implementations of traceability systems record weights or percentages relating to how much went into and how much came out of each transformation. The transformation is the actual joining or splitting of TRUs whereas the transformation metadata are all the data relating to or describing the transformation (e.g. time or duration of transformation and temperature or humidity at the location of the transformation). If these parameters are considered relevant the data in question also have to be recorded. Once the type of identifier to use has been selected and a way to associate the identifier to the TRU has been found the user would have the ability to record attributes associated with the TRU in question (e.g. fat content food business operator name and address and results from organoleptic tests) and to link these attributes to the TRU identifier. For most food business operators the value of a traceability system lies in obtaining access to the many TRU attributes. It is important to realize that a traceability system as outlined above keeps track of claims and these claims may or may not be true. �Claim� in this context is defined as �Statement where a product is said or implied to have a certain characteristic� (European Committee for Standardization 2019). These claims can be explicit (on the label or in the accompanying information) or implicit (if the product had the characteristic in question it should have been declared). For this reason validation and verification of the recorded claims is an important undertaking; see entry on data validation and verification in Table 2.  3.3. Traceability and related concepts Several concepts are related to traceability and it is important to clarify the connection between these and the concept of traceability. Table 2 provides such a clarification.   6  Table 2. Concepts related to traceability Traceability and � (in alphabetical order)  Comments � analytical methods Currently there are a multitude of analytical methods and instruments in use to measure certain physical and biochemical properties of food products (e.g. DNA fingerprinting spectroscopy) Analytical methods are essential when it comes to verifying (or falsifying) claims in the traceability systems but they do not in themselves provide traceability. While analytical methods can be very useful there are many relevant food product properties that cannot be analytically verified especially in the captured fish industry. These include properties such as fishing location gear type quota allocation identity of food business operator or owner at various stages in the chain processing conditions that did not directly influence the food properties data on yield and economics as well as properties relating to ethics sustainability and legality. � blockchain technology Blockchain is a distributed digital ledger architecture that may be suited to support electronic traceability systems for food products. For more details see Olsen Borit and Syed (2019). � catch/trade documentation schemes There are numerous mandatory and voluntary catch/trade documentations schemes (CTDS) in use around the world and while they have properties in common with a traceability system they do not in themselves constitute traceability systems. They involve some very relevant recorded identifications but the set of recorded data is limited and often selected for one purpose only (e.g. customs control document legal provenance of captured fish) and CTDS do not apply throughout the entire life cycle of the product in question. A traceability system is �live� in that one can keep adding data on traceable resource units (TRUs) as long as they exist; a CTDS provides snapshots of a subset of the information at a certain time and place; typically when first-hand sale is conducted or when the product passes a border. � chain of custody While traceability and chain of custody (CoC) to some degree have the same goal (well-documented fish products) their approach is different. In a traceability system anything can be recorded as an attribute of the TRU. In a CoC system the goal is to document and protect the integrity of one particular attribute. For captured fish this attribute is typically the fishery (location vessel type gear type) that the fish comes from and a particular fishery is assigned a CoC identifier. In a traceability system any sort of mixing/joining units is allowed as long as it is documented while in a CoC system only units with the same origin can be mixed/joined. After the transformation a new unit and a new identifier is created in a traceability system while in a CoC system units with the same origin retain their CoC identifier. � data validation and verification Contrary to popular belief traceability is not a method to ensure that information about a certain product is true or accurate; traceability systems contain claims about the food product in question and these claims may or may not be true. Some of these claims are related to chemical physical or sensory attributes of the food and these claims can (to some degree of accuracy at least) be tested by analytical methods. Examples of analytical methods approaches and instruments include (European Committee for Standardization 2019): DNA-based analyses; stable isotope and trace element analyses; liquid chromatography; gas chromatography; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; vibrational spectroscopy including near-infrared or Raman spectroscopy; mass spectrometry; microscopy; general food chemistry analysis; sensory analysis. � harmonization and standardization Standards are closely connected to chain traceability because chain traceability requires trading partners to exchange a large amount of information and unless they agree in great detail about what everything means and how it should be structured and represented information loss is bound to happen. In principle the internal traceability in a company can be effective without resorting to standards but it is the recordings in the internal traceability system that provides the data that are exchanged in the chain traceability system and upon reception the data need to be in standard format if the trading partner is to understand it. 7 Traceability and � (in alphabetical order)  Comments � interoperability Internationally agreed and harmonized data standards and formats are key for enabling interoperable traceability systems. Interoperability among seafood traceability systems will help facilitate business-to-business information exchange facilitate the verifiability of the data those systems contain and allow businesses the flexibility to choose the technology solution that best fits their traceability needs. Interoperability is achieved by standardizing the foregoing components and the vocabularies and formats used to share the data across multiple actors. In this domain the business-to-business platform Global Dialogue on Seafood Traceability has performed substantial work to define these components in terms suited to the seafood sector and in particular for the purposes of helping ensure legal product origin and supporting responsible sourcing practices. For more details see www.traceability-dialogue.org � transparency Transparency of a supply chain is the degree of shared understanding of and access to product-related information as requested by a supply chain�s stakeholders without loss noise delay or distortion. However transparency and traceability are not the same thing because the latter only sets the framework for the former. Source: Based on Borit and Olsen 2016.  8 4. UPDATES REGARDING EXISTING TRACEABILITY STANDARDS AND NORMS Previous analysis of traceability practices (Andre 2013; Borit and Olsen 2016) identified three main categories of traceability standards and norms which this study also follows: international standards and guidelines regulatory standards and industry and non-governmental organization (NGO) non-regulatory standards. All the current traceability standards refer to implementation of traceability and none of them to certification of already implemented traceability systems. Table 3 provides a summary of these standards and norms together with their latest updates.   9 Table 3. Summary of existing traceability standards and norms Standards and norms Description Updates 1. International standards and guidelines. These are developed to define and/or to provide best practices in tracing food products through supply chains. 1.1 Codex Alimentarius (the �Food Code�) It was established by FAO and the World Health Organization in 1963 to develop harmonized international food standards which protect consumer health and promote fair practices in food trade. The definition of traceability used here reduces traceability to following movement of food products only. Latest update: 2006. Publication of principles for traceability / product tracing as a tool within a food inspection and certification system (FAO and WHO 2006). 1.2 Office International des Epizooties (OIE) Aquatic Animal Health Code (the �Aquatic Code�) It sets standards for the improvement of aquatic animal health and welfare of farmed fish worldwide and for safe international trade in aquatic animals (amphibians crustaceans fish and molluscs) and their products. It emphasizes that traceability should be a demonstration of government veterinary services� capacity to exercise control over all animal health matters and not a description of the responsibility of private stakeholders in the chain. Latest update: 2016. Provisions ensuring sufficient assurance of traceability in such a way that the history and movements of aquatic animals can be documented and audited (OIE 2019). 1.3 FAO Guidelines 1.3.1 Marine capture fisheries � ecolabelling 1.3.2 Aquaculture � certification 1.3.3 Inland fisheries It summarizes several principles that should be observed by ecolabelling schemes. The difference between traceability and chain of custody (CoC) is relevant here. Latest update: 2009. Paragraph 16 refers to CoC and traceability (FAO 2009). It provides guidance for the development organization and implementation of credible aquaculture certification schemes. The difference between traceability and CoC is relevant here. No updates since publication in 2011. It uses the Food Code definition of traceability. Paragraph 16 refers to CoC and traceability (FAO 2011). It does not include any references to traceability. No updates since publication in 1997 (FAO 1997). 1.4 Catch/trade documentation schemes (CTDS) These are important fisheries management tools but are not designed as traceability systems for markets/consumers; for a detailed analysis of this aspect see MRAG (2010). For latest updates on CDS and traceability see (Hosch and Blaha 2017). FAO has adopted Voluntary Guidelines for CDS (FAO 2017). 2. Regulations. Binding norms that are set by particular countries. Set the minimum traceability requirements.1 2.1 European Union Relevant regulations: European Commission Regulation 178/2002 (General Food Law) Regulation 1005/2008 and the corresponding Implementation Regulation 1010/2009 Regulation 1224/2009 and the corresponding Implementation Regulation 404/2011. These require a one-step-forward one-step-back approach as well as lot-based traceability an approach considered ineffective by speciality literature (Borit and Santos 2015; Borit 2016). For a recent summary of the food traceability system in Europe see (Mania et al. 2018).  After the evaluation of the current situation the European Commission decided to initiate a revision of the fisheries control system. Its proposal to revise the fisheries control system was adopted on 30.05.2018.2 This proposal includes extensive modifications to traceability provisions. At the moment of publishing this report this proposal was is the first reading step at the Council of the Latest consolidated version of Regulation 178/2002: 26.07.2019.3 Latest consolidated version of Regulation 1005/2008: 09.03.2011.4 Latest consolidated version of Regulation 1010/2009: 17.09.2013.5 Latest consolidated version of Regulation 1224/2009: 14.08.2019.6 Latest consolidated version of Regulation 404/2011: 01.01.2017.7  10 Standards and norms Description Updates European Union. For an analysis of the EU seafood traceability see the common report DG SANTE � DG MARE in Alcantara and Nordstr�m (2019). 2.2 United States of America The United States of America has a history of implementing policy aimed at improving seafood traceability and labelling. For a detailed recent analysis see: Blakistone and Mavity (2019); Stevens (2019). The United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration enacted the Seafood Import Monitoring Program in an effort to combat illegal unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing through mandating improved seafood traceability requirements. This programme requires reporting of fisheries data from harvest to arrival at the United States border (He 2018; Willette and Cheng 2018). 2.3 Japan Traceability systems for animals and animal products (e.g. cattle and beef) are established but only for a few foods and other commodities (e.g. rice). Guidelines for developing traceability systems are being established by industry associations rather than by national legislature. For a detailed analysis see Charlebois et al. (2014). There are governmental labelling requirements within the Quality Labeling Standard for Perishable Foods (2000) (Lewis and Boyle 2017). Latest update of traceability guidelines: 2007. See FMRIC (2008). 3. Nonregulatory standards. This category includes guidelines for auditing and other measures to ensure successful application of commercial standards that have been delivered by organizations and associations to set traceability requirements facilitate data 3.1 International Organization for Standardization (ISO) ISO 8402:1994 Quality management and quality assurance: This standard is considered to contain the least incomplete definition of product traceability: �[t]he ability to trace the history application or location of an entity by means of recorded identifications.� This definition clearly states what should be traced (history application and location) and how the tracing should be performed by means of recorded identifications. This standard was superseded by ISO 9000. ISO 9000:2015 Quality management systems. Traceability is the ability to identify and trace the history distribution location and application of products parts materials and services. A traceability system records and follows the trail as products parts materials and services come from suppliers and are processed and ultimately distributed as final products and services. ISO 22000:2018 Food safety management systems. Traceability is defined as the ability to follow the history application movement and location of an object through specified stage(s) of production processing and distribution. ISO 22005:2007 Traceability in the feed and food chain. ISO 12875/12877:2011 Traceability of finfish products � Specification on the information to be recorded in captured/farmed finfish distribution chains. ISO 16741/18537:2015 Traceability of crustacean products � Specifications on the information to be recorded in farmed/captured crustacean distribution chains. ISO 22005:2007 was last reviewed and confirmed in 2016.  ISO 12875:2011 was last reviewed and confirmed in 2016.  ISO 12877:2011 was last reviewed and confirmed in 2016.  Note that in the more recent definitions the fragment �by means of recorded identifications� has been removed which has consequences as explained in Olsen and Borit (2013). ISO 22005 adds: �Terms such as document traceability computer traceability or commercial traceability should be avoided.� 11 Standards and norms Description Updates sharing and adopt product identification standards for commercial purposes. ISO 18538/18539:2015 Traceability of molluscan products � Specifications on the information to be recorded in farmed/captured molluscan distribution chains. These standards use the ISO definition of traceability which is: �The ability to trace the history application or location of that which is under consideration.� 3.2 Food industry Several industrial associations have developed their own traceability standards including: the United States National Fisheries Institute; the European Union Fish Processors Association and the European Union Federation of National Organisations of Importers and Exporters of Fish (AIPCE-CEP); and the British Retail Consortium Global Standard for Food Safety Issue 6.  There are also examples of large retailers that have also taken initiatives for implementing traceability systems based on state-of-the art information technology (e.g. the blockchain food traceability system for fresh fish launched by Carrefour [FIS 2019]).  A development observed recently is the emergence of international business-tobusiness communities working together to share ideas and collaborate on solutions for legal and sustainable seafood with a particular focus on traceability. Examples of such entities are the Seafood Alliance for Legality and Traceability (SALT: www.salttraceability.org/) and the Global Dialogue on Seafood Traceability (GDST; https://traceability-dialogue.org/). The main focus of the latter is to advance a unified framework for interoperable seafood traceability practices. United States National Fisheries Institute � latest update: 2011 (NFI 2011). For a recent review of relevant industrial practices see: Crona K�ll and Van Holt (2019); Lewis and Boyle (2017).  Version 1.0 of the GDST standard is available as of March 2020 at: https://traceabilitydialogue.org/core-documents/gdst-1-0materials/ 3.3 Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) / non-profit initiatives Major leading internationally established fishery/aquaculture certification programmes (e.g. National Marine Fisheries Service Dolphin Safe Marine Stewardship Council) have developed their own certification schemes that also claim to address the traceability issue. Each set of standards has its own focus (e.g. assurance of minimal environmental impacts organic certification) and its own individual structure and presentation.  Other initiatives focus on connecting and convening networks of companies nonprofit organizations and policymakers involved in key traceability projects and precompetitive collaborations (e.g. FishWise Future of Fish [Lewis and Boyle 2017]). For recent review of traceability-related NGO initiatives see: Cochrane (2018); Crona K�ll and Van Holt (2019); Lewis and Boyle (2017); Punt et al. (2016). 12 Standards and norms Description Updates 3.4 Technology providers As described in Lewis and Boyle (2017) many traceability technology providers are relatively new to seafood compared with other commodities such as produce where traceability technology and third?party vendors are better established. However the last decade has seen tremendous growth in the number of companies providing traceability software for seafood data capture sharing and tracking. These systems can operate within a single company or be linked to track products throughout a supply chain (from harvest to point of sale).  1 Ranking scores of 21 countries from Organisation for Economic Co?operation and Development based on comprehensiveness of traceability regulations for domestic and imported products can be found in Charlebois et al. 2014. 2 Text available at: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52018PC0368 3 Text available at: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32002R0178&qid=1575079574678 4 Text available at: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX%3A32008R1005 5 Text available at: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32009R1010 6 Text available at: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX%3A32009R1224 7 Text available at: https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32011R0404 Source: Structure based on Borit and Olsen 2016 with modifications. 13 5. BENEFITS AND SUCCESS CASES 5.1. Benefits of implementing a traceability system For the scope of this chapter it is important to differentiate between drivers and benefits. As explained in Table 1 a driver is a determinant that leads firms to decide how to allocate their financial resources in implementing different levels of voluntary traceability; a motivating factor. For a summary of traceability drivers see Borit and Olsen (2016). A benefit is an advantage or profit gained from something in this case from the implementation of a traceability system and as such can be evaluated after the implementation of the system.  Previous research (Stor�y Thakur and Olsen 2013) identified that the main obstacle for successful and efficient implementation of traceability in food product chains is organizational not technical. In general food businesses are not motivated to implement new standards for information exchange and traceability as they perceive this as an additional cost and are not aware of the associated benefits. Moreover companies are not willing to make changes to their current operational practices. In addition companies are also concerned about data security and are not willing to share sensitive information unless it is protected in trusted repositories but this issue is secondary to their reluctance to change their current practices. Better awareness of various benefits of implementing a traceability system might help change these perceptions. Tables 4 and 5 provide an extensive enumeration of possible benefits of (sea)food traceability grouped by stakeholders (Table 4) and by main categories (Table 5). It is noteworthy that there are cultural differences in benefits perceived by consumers (van Rijswijk et al. 2008).  There are two main classes of drivers relating to the benefits outlined in Tables 4 and 5 as indicated by the red and green colours:  ? �Negative drivers� are related to what the firm must do or more or less feel forced to do. They include meeting specific traceability requirements in legislation in standards that the firm has adopted or requested by the buyers customers consumers and/or market in question. They also include drivers related to reducing risks in particular in relation to food safety and food fraud and to short-term reduction in costs resource use and waste. ? �Positive drivers� are voluntary and relate to the potential for using traceability to add value to the product to improve quality and to improve communication and information interchange in the supply chain. In particular they include drivers related to product differentiation and storytelling and to sustainability and ethics (beyond what is legally or contractually required).  The negative drivers exist for all companies and they are linked to minimum requirements related to what the company needs to do to comply with laws regulations and standards in order to meet market requirements for traceability transparency and product documentation and to keep costs low. The positive drivers exist only for companies that want to use traceability and improved product documentation as part of their value-adding and branding strategy. The distinction between negative and positive drivers is not binary; rather the respective drivers should be viewed as being on a continuous scale from �absolute requirements all companies must have this degree of traceability otherwise they cannot operate� (negative) through drivers that are relevant for many but not all companies all the way to drivers only applicable for companies that have traceability and transparency as part of their branding strategy and that will or might record anything that can add value to the product or the production process (positive).  14 Table 4.

Source: Asioli Boecker and Canavari 2014.  In general seafood traceability can be improved in two different ways:  ? If the focus is on the negative drivers e.g. by increasing the requirements related to traceability in laws or standards this will affect the companies with a minimalistic approach towards traceability and product documentation but it will not largely affect the companies that use traceability as part of their competitive advantage as these already record a lot more data than the minimum required. ? If the focus is on the positive drivers e.g. through efforts designed to increase the value added by providing more information through storytelling or through profiling desirable characteristics this will affect the companies that want to use traceability as part of their competitive advantage but it will not largely affect the companies that only do the minimum required when it comes to traceability. 17 Many large seafood companies have a mixed strategy on this; they will of course satisfy all the minimum requirements and they also go beyond these in areas where they can see it is profitable but they are not first movers or early adopters when it comes to new technologies (e.g. automated identification and data capture Internet of Things-enabled sensors or blockchain) new types of data (e.g. details on vessel fisher or fish farmer resource use and CO2 emissions) or new communication strategies (e.g. product detailed description online accessible by scanning QR-code on product or visualization of supply chain). Still if value adding and success are demonstrated by companies that focus on positive drivers the �middle of the road� (often large) companies will gradually adopt technologies and practices when they have been proved to work.  From a value creation perspective the different categories of benefits have different potential for accumulating value (Figure 2).  Figure 2. Traceability benefits hierarchy  Source: Sparling and Sterling 2004.  As such food business operators can extract significant value from implementation of traceability and extend from a �must do� to comply with regulatory requirements (i.e. negative drivers) to a �must have� to differentiate their products in the market place and improve supply management to derive cumulative value (i.e. positive drivers) as described in Figure 3 (GS1 2013).   18 Figure 3. From �compliance traceability� to �value traceability�  Source: GS1 2013.   5.2. Success cases Storytelling is a powerful persuasion tool (Gottschall 2012) that has been successfully used in domains such as marketing (Vincent 2002) organizational management (Spear and Roper 2016) and healthcare (Gray 2009) and it is considered to have a high impact potential in climate change research (Moezzi Janda and Rotmann 2017). Therefore showcasing traceability success stories might be an effective tool in raising awareness about the benefits of implementing a traceability system. However comprehensive accounts of traceability success stories are scarce and where such stories are available the information that they offer is difficult to differentiate in terms of incentives drivers or benefits. This study gathered together cases related to some of the main actors in the seafood industry and looked at how they frame their own traceability story. In addition to these descriptions Table 6 summarizes some selected food traceability success stories from various world regions stemming from different initiatives and expressed in a multitude of forms � from structured reports to short information from own websites to accounts in online media outlets.  A processor/exporter � importer story: Blue Ocean Grace International (BOGI) Indonesia and Anova the United States of America (The Oceans and Fisheries Partnership 2019).  In 2018 Anova a leading sushi-quality tuna company from the United States of America joined the network of partners of the United States Agency for International Development Oceans and Fisheries Partnership (USAID Oceans) to establish full chain traceability for tuna products harvested in Southeast Asia that are imported into the United States of America. This is done by documenting the seafood�s journey from its point of catch to its point of sale. To establish full chain traceability partnerships are required throughout the seafood supply chain from the fishers who are the first to touch the fish to the importers � such as � that are the last. Together with its partner and grantee Yayasan Masyarakat dan Perikanan Indonesia (MDPI) USAID Oceans has recruited small- and large-scale industry partners in USAID Oceans� learning site at Bitung Indonesia. Anova sources its seafood from an Indonesia tuna processor Blue Ocean Grace International (BOGI) a USAID Oceans first-mover partner that is participating in the electronic catch documentation and traceability system. In February 2018 BOGI began using TraceTales a traceability application that allows processors to electronically track their inventory as it moves through the processing factory � from receiving to filleting packaging freezing and shipping. TraceTales developed by the MDPI enabled BOGI to convert its old 100 percent paper19 based recording system to a fully digital computer-based system that allows it to electronically capture store and manage product data. Reported benefits for Anova are: increased assurance in meeting import requirements; greater ability to meet customer requirements; and enhanced efficiency and business intelligence. Reported benefits for BOGI are: increased accuracy and efficiency in operations and data management; reduced product recalls and waste; increased capacity for data analysis and business decision-making; and reduced operational costs.  A retailer story: Carrefour (FIS 2019)  Carrefour has designed own strict traceability requirements for the food products sold through its supermarkets. Because of its diversity and quantity the fisheries sector constitutes a major challenge in terms of sustainability and Carrefour therefore works on requirements such as traceability selection of fishing grounds respect for minimum sizes and promotion of local fisheries. In 2017 it started the introduction � for the first time in retail � of blockchain technology used to enable traceability of product lines (e.g. eggs honey cheese and tomatoes) guaranteeing consumers as much transparency as possible. This initiative was driven by the fact that the demand for transparency and traceability is now a core issue for all its consumers and the blockchain is considered by this retailer to be a thoroughly effective reliable and innovative solution that meets this requirement. In 2019 Carrefour launched worldwide the first blockchain food traceability system for fresh fish. In Spain the company announced the application of this technology to the line-caught hake �Quality and Origin� which represented a milestone worldwide as it was the first time that this system had been used on an extractive fishing product. The product sold by Carrefour includes in its labelling a QR code that can be scanned through a smartphone. Thus the consumer can obtain complete information on each of the hake that arrives at the Carrefour centres as this product is traced unit by unit. For example the consumer can learn which boat made the catch the coordinates of the fishing area the fishing gear used the exact location of the fish market where it was landed how it was conditioned and when it was delivered to Carrefour. The line-caught hake offered by Carrefour is available within 24 hours at the chain�s fishmongers throughout Spain. The new system is considered to provide transparency reliability and total information to the consumer.  A seafood traceability software provider story: TraceVerified (FAO and ITU 2017)  TraceVerified is a transparent information and electronic traceability service in Viet Nam that provides electronic traceability systems for ten supply chains related to shrimp catfish blue-fin tuna rice tea sweet potato frozen vegetable dragon fruit fruit syrup honey and cashew-nut products. It is owned by the 100% Vietnamese Traceability Solutions and Services Joint Stock Company. Launched in 2016 TraceVerified collects and transports verified information from food producers to food buyers and it allows buyers to verify product information independently and conveniently. An analysis of the impact of this initiative shows that: (i) small and medium-sized enterprises using the system have experienced reduced operational costs better credibility and improved brand reputation in the market; (ii) smallholder producers have been enabled to communicate transparently their cultivation methods to customers and retailers which has helped establish stable market links and steady production and sales of their produce which has improved their income; and (iii) consumers have gained awareness about food safety and thus been able to make better and more informed purchasing decisions. However despite these benefits reported by the users of the TraceVerified systems the interest for using it is rather low for various reasons among which lack of awareness about the value and benefits of electronic traceability and lack of mandatory requirements for traceability are considered to play an important role.  A non-profit organization story: Future of Fish (Future of Fish 2020)  Future of Fish defines itself as a non-profit systems change incubator that works with industry players technologists and NGOs to create business solutions to ocean challenges. For almost a decade its approach has been to build strategic collective impact of entrepreneurs businesses governments and NGOs by facilitating collaborations that accelerate traceability technology adoption better governance 20 value chain alignment and financial investment in fisheries. Its method starts with embedded ethnographic research that looks at supply chains from the source up. By analysing the choke points and the identified strategies for overcoming them the syntheses yield insights about overarching challenges that remain unaddressed and how assets can be leveraged among stakeholders to forge progress or develop new structures. Facilitating co-design of systematic solutions Future of Fish then stays in the system coordinating players and helping scale projects to achieve sustained and replicable progress.  A legislator story: European Commission Regulation 178/2002 (General Food Law) (European Commission 2019)  At the beginning of 2019 the Directorate General for Health and Food Safety of the European Commission (DG SANTE) published its findings in relation to the Fitness Check of the General Food Law Regulation (EC) No. 178/2000 (GFL Regulation) which had been concluded by the end of 2017.  A fitness check of the regulation was conducted to evaluate whether the established general principles and requirements are appropriate for the purpose by identifying excessive regulatory burdens overlaps gaps inconsistencies and/or obsolete measures. In general the evaluation found that the GFL Regulation remains relevant and has succeeded in achieving a high level of protection of human health and consumers� interests in relation to food while contributing to the effective functioning of the internal market. However the GFL Regulation was found to be less adequate in addressing new challenges such as food sustainability and in particular food waste.  According to this study it has proved difficult to identify quantitative indicators to measure the overall impacts (costs and benefits) of the general principles and requirements laid down in the GFL Regulation. As such the quantification of benefits for consumers and public health in economic terms requires a case-by-case analysis. However more than half of consulted food business operators (FBOs) included in the study (57 percent) have indicated that overall the benefits of traceability have outweighed the relevant costs. The benefits have mainly been felt by those FBOs trading within the internal market as they can benefit from harmonization. Nonetheless 23 percent of FBOs indicated that benefits have not for the most part outweighed costs while 21 percent did not provide an answer because they were not in a position to know. Those FBOs tended to be smaller and craft enterprises that are more active in national markets. Therefore they do not benefit from the harmonized requirements of the internal market but still have to cope with the administrative burden stemming from other secondary food legislation of the European Union. However given the diversity of the sector it cannot be concluded that harmonization benefits larger enterprises more than smaller ones as in practice a large range of operational contexts can prevail.  A vast majority of the small and medium-sized enterprises included in the study indicated the following benefits of the traceability system: it makes it easier to manage risk in food/feed safety incidents (85 percent of respondents); it helps identify which products need to be withdrawn from the market (83 percent); and it maintains consumer trust by providing accurate information on products affected by a food safety incident (75 percent). A smaller majority of respondents indicated that the system prevents unnecessary disruption to trade (54 percent) and improves business management (60 percent) although a relatively important share of respondents did not know whether the traceability system has these particular benefits (23 percent and 13 percent respectively).     21 Table 6.

POLICY INCENTIVES TO ENCOURAGE THE ESTABLISHMENT OF COMPANY TRACEABILITY In this study incentive is defined as a way to stimulate desired behaviour in this case the implementation of a traceability system. It serves as a motivational device for a desired action or behaviour. This section proposes three different categorizations of incentives from broad incentives to very specific incentives from the food production domain. These categories can be used by interested entities when formulating strategies and specific incentives to encourage the establishment of company seafood traceability.  One common categorization of incentives divides these into three broad classes (Dalkir 2005):  1. Remunerative incentives (or financial incentives) are said to exist where an agent can expect some form of material reward (or gain) � especially money � in exchange for acting in a particular way. 2. Moral incentives are said to exist where a particular choice is widely regarded as the right thing to do or as particularly admirable or where the failure to act in a certain way is condemned as wrong. A company acting on a moral incentive can expect approval or even admiration from the community; a company acting against a moral incentive can expect a condemnation or even ostracism from the community. 3. Coercive incentives are said to exist where a company can expect that the failure to act in a particular way will result in force being used against it by entities with power (e.g. government or industry association).  Drawing on a previous FAO study about incentives for adoption of good agricultural practices (GAPs) among which there is also the implementation of a traceability system (Hobbs 2007) a second categorization distinguishes among three broad categories of incentives: economic incentives regulatory/legal incentives and human capital incentives. These incentives could be extrapolated to the implementation of traceability systems.  The disincentives to adopt GAPs include economic disincentives institutional infrastructure constraints and human capital constraints. It is important to note that the disincentives are often the mirror image of the incentives to adopt in the sense that adoption of GAPs to for example achieve price premiums (an incentive) may be accompanied by higher production costs (a disincentive). As such they may occur simultaneously. Table 7 provides an overview of these incentives and disincentives.  Table 7. Incentives/disincentives to adopt good agricultural practices (GAP) among which the implementation of a traceability systems Incentive Farmer incentive Processor/retailer incentive Economic Price premium xx Access to market / supply chain xx Access to reliable inputs xx Product differentiation x xx Stabilize yield/revenue xx Reduce storage losses x x Reduce wastage x xx Increase asset value x Protection against market externalities x Increase variable production costs (e.g. labour) -- -Reduce output/increase average cost -- -24 Incentive Farmer incentive Processor/retailer incentive Increase fixed production costs (e.g. equipment) -- -Asset-specific investment1 - Reduce search costs x x Reduce monitoring cost x or - 2 Altruism / social capital x x Regulatory/legal/institutional Asserting property rights on scarce resources x Subsidies x x Reduce liability / show due diligence x xx Reliance on institutional infrastructure - Third-party monitoring x x Human capital Expand skill set x x? Record-keeping (literacy) - - 1 An asset specific investment has little or no value in an alternative use e.g. inputs or equipment that are specific to one buyer. Having made the investment the primary producer is vulnerable to the buyer acting opportunistically by reneging on a supply agreement. 2 Depends on the presence of third-party verification that lowers monitoring costs. Without third-party verification processors/retailers will probably face higher monitoring costs. Notes: xx = strong incentive to implement; x = marginal incentive to implement; -- = strong disincentive to implement; - = marginal disincentive to implement. Source: Hobbs 2007.  A third categorization of incentives to implement a traceability system is based on (Valluri 2012) and divides incentives in intrinsic incentives (i.e. originate within each entity or an actor of the supply chain depending on their own interest and specialization) extrinsic incentives (i.e. originate external to each entity in the supply chain) and social incentives (i.e. occur due to the intangible rewards offered by the society - both consumers and non-consumers of the respective food - associated with the supply chain; these originate from the supply chain entity�s perceived social relations). An overview of all these incentives can be found in Table 8. Intrinsic extrinsic and social incentives are interlinked with each other. However extrinsic incentives were found to be stronger than intrinsic and social incentives respectively. Extrinsic incentives were recommended to the studied supply chain businesses government and social entities for a better implementation of traceability systems in the respective supply chain. From among the extrinsic incentives transparency demand by its downstream supply chain partner seemed to be the strongest item from this category. Legislation on traceability by the government could act as a stronger incentive than a subsidy from the government. From among the intrinsic incentives company�s commitment to food safety desire to achieve accuracy and ease of recall and awareness of past food safety crisis seemed to act as the strongest such incentives together with envisaged profits. An active role by animal welfare social organizations and media could act as strong social incentives. Likewise the active role of media producing stories on human and labour rights abuses and/or environmental degradation along supply chains is likely to spur company action in improving traceability.  25 Table 8. Incentives for implementation of a traceability system INTRINSIC INCENTIVES Commitment to food safety Strategy Accuracy and ease of recall Awareness of crisis Lean thinking (i.e. a practice that considers the expenditure of resources for any goal other than value creation for the end-customer to be wasteful and thus there is a target of elimination) Innovation management of product quality Process costs Intention to protect market share EXTRINSIC INCENTIVES Transparency demand by the downstream supply-chain partner Upstream supply-chain partner being transparent Financial reward Legislation Final consumer�s food safety concern Branding of a downstream supply-chain partner Government subsidies Technical support by downstream supply-chain entity SOCIAL INCENTIVES Satisfaction with being transparent to society Society�s appreciation for animal welfare Social pressure to practise fair labour standards [NB: Authors� addition.] Social pride Pressure from non-governmental organizations Naming and shaming by media Note: Entries in bold indicate a strong incentive. Source: Compiled from Valluri (2012).  Governments have intervened in food agricultural and fisheries markets through various support programmes to promote adoption of traceability practices and systems in order to raise food-safety levels and increase industry competitiveness. There are intended and unintended effects of participation in such supporting programmes. Intended effects comprise the impacts on traceability capacity levels costs and benefits of programme participants vs. comparable non-participants. Unintended effects concern the firm�s planning accuracy measured through deviations of actual from expected outcomes. According to an analysis of Italian fishery businesses (Boecker and Asioli 2016) although recipients of government support have higher average levels of traceability capacity and overall benefits than those who did not receive such support differences are not statistically significant. In regard to the unintended effects of government support recipients of government support reported larger deviations of actual from expected benefits than did the non-recipients. While these differences were not significant at the aggregate level significant differences are found at the level of specific benefit categories. For example support recipients had overestimated sales- and price-related benefits but severely underestimated efficiency gains in operations. The results suggest that the motivation for participating in a government support programme may not align with the firm�s strategic goals. This misalignment may reduce planning accuracy.  According to Golan et al. (2003) policies targeted at providing firms with incentives to establish efficient recall systems will probably be less costly and more successful than policies that mandate traceability. Such policies include the following: recall and other food-safety performance standards; any policy that increases the likelihood that producers of unsafe food will be identified and punished; and any policy that increases the punishment for producing and selling unsafe foods. Mandatory traceability may not be the most efficient policy tool because as most process standards it precludes efficient innovation by firms by stipulating the method for achieving the objective. Usually performance standards � rather than process standards � ensure the most efficient compliance systems. In addition mandatory systems that prescribe one traceability template and fail to allow for variation across systems 26 are likely to impose costs that are not justified by efficiency gains. The characteristics of an efficient traceability system vary from industry to industry and from firm to firm. Mandatory systems that fail to allow for variation will impose unnecessary costs on firms that are already operating efficient traceability systems. However it is crucial that companies take into consideration systems interoperability when deciding what traceability system to implement.  27 7. RECOMMENDATIONS The recommendations of this study are:  1. There is still a lack of knowledge about the benefits of introducing a traceability system among the actors in seafood supply chains (Parre�o-Marchante et al. 2014; Stor�y Thakur and Olsen 2013). Communicating and understanding the benefits of a traceability system are important for successful implementation of traceability. Interested agencies should fund awareness raising campaigns in order to spread the knowledge about these diverse benefits and their implications for value creation. A comprehensive list of benefits of implementation of traceability can be found in Chapter 5 (Tables 4 and 5). Success cases are compiled in Table 6. 2. There are cultural differences in benefits perceived by different groups of stakeholders (van Rijswijk et al. 2008). At the same time risk communication is more effective if it is adapted to the culture of the audience (Renn 2008). Thus interested agencies should adapt the communication strategy of the benefits of traceability raising awareness campaign to the cultural specificities of the audience. 3. Organizations can extract significant value from implementing traceability and extend from a �must-do� to comply with regulatory requirements to a �must have� to differentiate their products in the marketplace (Figure 2) (GS1 2013). The communication strategy of traceability benefits has to include an awareness-raising campaign that focuses specifically on the value creation potential of traceability systems. 4. Besides the lack of knowledge about the benefits of traceability among the actors in seafood supply chains there is also the need for more cost�benefits studies (Karlsen et al. 2012) to be communicated to possible stakeholders. Interested agencies should commission such cost� benefit studies and disseminate the results widely. 5. Traceability success stories/cases are littles documented especially for developing countries. Interested agencies should commission studies of such success stories with specific requirements of what has to be recorded in a structured and systematic way in terms of traceability incentives drivers and benefits. 6. In general food businesses are not motivated to implement new standards for information exchange and traceability as they perceive this as an additional cost and are not aware of the associated benefits. In addition companies are not willing to make changes to their current operational practices. Similarly companies are also concerned about data security and are not willing to share sensitive information unless it is protected in trusted repositories but this issue is secondary to their reluctance to change their current practices (Stor�y Thakur and Olsen 2013). Interested agencies should commission a study of the motivations for adopting traceability systems that also explore possible solutions to the concerns raised by food businesses. 7. There is still a lack of understanding about what kind of perceptions can influence the internal attitudes and motivations of the firm to implement a traceability system (Abd Rahman et al. 2017. Interested agencies should commission a study of the reasons for not adopting traceability systems. 8. Extrinsic incentives were found to be stronger than intrinsic and social incentives (Valluri 2012). As such extrinsic incentives could be recommended to businesses government and social entities for a better implementation of traceability systems in the respective supply chain. 9. Policy targeted at providing firms with incentives to establish efficient recall systems will be less costly to firms and consumers and better targeted than policy mandating traceability. Usually performance standards � rather than process standards � ensure the most efficient compliance systems (Golan et al. 2003). Governments and industry associations should focus on formulating policies targeted at providing firms with incentives to establish efficient actions such as recalls. In the example of more efficient recalls such policies include the following: recall and other food safety performance standards; any policy that increases the likelihood that producers of unsafe food will be identified and punished; and any policy that increases the punishment for producing and selling unsafe foods.  28 10. Regulatory interventions do not drive the technological evolution of food traceability systems (Brofman Epelbaum and Garcia Martinez 2014). Interested agencies should commission a study about the drivers of implementing traceability systems to complement this study on benefits and incentives. 11. Contrary to popular belief traceability is not a method to ensure that information about a certain product is true or accurate; traceability systems contain claims about the food product in question and these claims may or may not be true. Some of these claims are related to chemical physical or sensory attributes of the food and these claims can (to some degree of accuracy at least) be tested by analytical methods such as DNA-based analyses or nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Interested agencies should commission studies specifically focused on data validation and verification of any types of claims in order to avoid the �garbage in / garbage out� problem and thus to increase the value of traceability systems. 12. It has been noted that �adoption of safety standards may promote power imbalances lack of trust and transparency and the easing of minimalistic strategies in dealing with food safety� (Ringsberg 2014; Sodano Hingley and Lindgreen 2008; Trienekens and Zuurbier 2008). Thus when adopting such standards governments and industry associations should implement initiatives to counterbalance such developments. For example strategies to avoid exclusion include: (i) providing ample education and training to overcome human capital constraints. (ii) fostering the development of the institutional infrastructure necessary to support implementation of traceability systems within a developing-country environment. (iii) encouraging the participation of producer associations or cooperatives to provide a critical mass in terms of supply provide a conduit for the dissemination of information on benefits of traceability to smallholders and improve the bargaining power of individual farmers/fishers vis�-vis larger retailers or processors. 13. Companies across the supply chain should consider adopting industry-wide use of the standards using globally unique identification of units as a significant step forward for electronic and interoperable seafood traceability. If using a globally unique unite code such as the Serial Global Trade Item Number rather than the Lot Global Trade Item Number an example of such standard is the Global Dialogue for Seafood Traceability (GDST) Standards and Guidelines for Interoperable Seafood Traceability Systems Version 1.0. These industry-developed standards are designed to improve the reliability of seafood information reduce the cost of traceability contribute to supply chain risk reduction and contribute to securing the long-term social and environmental sustainability of the sector.  Underlying many of these recommendations is the fact that what the society needs and what the consumer prefers is full chain traceability from vessel or aquaculture site to plate. What companies tend to focus on is their own internal traceability largely limited to inputs (raw materials and ingredients) and outputs (products) from their own processes. This difference in perspective has many ramifications in particular related to the need for unit identification. The traceability systems in most seafood companies are batch-based and this identification principle is also the basis for most standards and good practice recommendations in this area. If the focus is internal traceability batch-based identification is fine because all units (boxes and cases) from the same batch have the same properties and it makes sense to identify them in the same way. However if the focus is full chain traceability batch-based identification is not a good solution. The reason is that the units in question (the units coming from the same production batch) can only be said to have the same properties when they are physically kept together. In practice in the seafood industry the units from a production batch (a cage a day�s slaughter a catch or a day�s processing) are not kept together throughout the chain. A production batch is often split up and different units from the same batch may be transported using different vehicles to the same or to different destinations. Once they arrive if the only available identifier is the batch identifier it is impossible to say what means of transportation was used what the unit location was at a given time or what the temperature was at a given time. Often other identifiers are temporarily affixed to the units as when a unit is part of a pallet and the pallet has a globally unique identifier. However it is not uncommon that the link to these additional identifiers are lost (e.g. when the pallet wrapping is discarded) so that the batch identifier is the only one that remains when the unit reaches its destination. While this can be used to access information related to the process that produced it it cannot be used to 29 access information about what happened subsequently and so it is not a good solution for full chain traceability.  Thus a final recommendation and one that underlies and supports many of the recommendations above is:  14. To achieve full chain traceability a shift in perspective is needed from a focus on documenting inputs and outputs to specific processes there and then to a focus on the ability to document all properties relating to the product or unit anywhere in the supply chain including origin process history location and any other attributes that might be relevant. For this batch identification is not sufficient and unique unit identification is needed. Interested agencies should commission studies that highlight the benefits of full chain traceability as opposed to internal traceability and in particular document the value of and benefits related to unique identification of units compared with batch-based identification of units.   30 8.

All rights reserved. Legal Requirements for Food Traceability in the European Union M. Borit University of Troms� (UiT) � The Arctic University of Norway Troms� Norway  12 1. Introduction Since the mid 90s traceability has become a popular concept in industrial logistics (Opara 2003) regardless of the production regime and type of product (Flapper et al. 2002; Jansen-Vullers et al. 2003). At the same time traceability has been both a politically and strategically controversial issue and has acted as a major deterrent for multidisciplinary cooperation and understanding (Vorst 2004). Transparency lies at the core of the decision to regulate traceability at the European  Union (EU) level as at the time that the first EU legal rule implementing traceability in the European food chains it was hoped that this risk management tool would increase food products� safety through increasing the transparency of the food chain. As a consequence of the multiple food scandals in Europe during the last two decades of the 20th Century such as the Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE or mad cow disease) and the dioxin contamination of chicken feed in Belgium the European Commission (EC) drew the first rules requiring the implementation of traceability in food chains at the Union level. This chapter looks closer at how the EU body of law related to food traceability came into being what the legal text entails and what are the consequences of this text. It is important to perform such an analysis of the legal text because the legislature sets minimum compliance requirements that businesses have to follow. Besides describing the EU food traceability legislation one objective of this chapter is to assess whether the wording of the legal text is consistent with the declared objective of the law which is to implement traceability throughout the entire product supply chain. The focus is on the words of the law articles and not on the general policy arguments usually formulated in the preamble of the legal rule. If the legal text has weaknesses traceability systems implemented as minimum requirements of this text can be ineffective and supply chains may thus become vulnerable to fraud as exemplified by the food scandals such as the beef-horsemeat one (NTB 2013). In such cases it is most likely that consumers might question their trust in a legislature that puts them at risk by using the notion of traceability inconsistently.

Background 2.1 The European Union Law 2.1.1 Difference Between Directives and Regulations As explained by the European Commission itself (European Union 2015) �there are three basic types of EU legislation: regulations directives and decisions. A regulation is similar to a national law with the difference that it is applicable in all EU countries. Directives set out general rules to be transferred into national law by each country as they deem appropriate. A decision only deals with a particular issue and specifically mentioned persons or organizations.� 2.1.2 Principles of Law The principles of consistency and coherence have a prominent place in the EU law (Barnard et al. 2013). Consistency refers to the absence of contradiction whereas coherence relates to �positive connections� or �the construction of a united whole� (Hillion 2014). The former refers to ideas of compatibility and of making good sense whereas the latter relates more to synergy and added value. �Hence coherence in law would be a matter of degree whereas consistency would be a static notion in the sense that concepts of law can be more or less coherent but cannot be more or less consistent. They are either consistent or not� (Hillion 2014). At a general level the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union stipulates that the EU shall ensure consistency between its policies and activities (European Commission 2012). From a theoretical point of view the meaning of consistency has been refined as horizontal consistency and vertical consistency. The latter applies to the relations between the Member States and the EU while the former focuses on implementation and refers to consistency at the EU level either interinstitutional or interpolicy (Minkova 2011). In terms of this second aspect consistency can be defined as �the way in which the substance of different policies generated by the EU forms part of whole� (Portela and Raube 2008). 2.2 The Concept of Traceability 2.2.1 What Is Traceability? Answering this question seems to be a difficult task and the food industry is the one where the most varied and contradictory definitions of traceability can be found. This situation is true although traceability has general common requirements and drivers across industries (Jansen-Vullers et al. 2003). To ascertain which definitions are most commonly used Olsen and Borit (2013) performed a comprehensive systematic literature review of scientific articles relating to food traceability giving an overview of relevant traceability definitions and outlining similarities differences and the consequences of choosing one definition over another. This study reveals that one-third of the reviewed scientific articles did not mention a traceability definition possibly meaning that their authors took the definition of Advances in Food Traceability Techniques and Technologies : Improving Quality Throughout the Food Chain edited by  Montserrat Espi�eira and Francisco J Santaclara Elsevier Science & Technology 2016.

E ls ev ie r S ci en ce  &  T ec hn ol og y.  A ll rig ht s re se rv ed . 227Legal Requirements for Food Traceability in the European Union traceability for granted. Out of the articles referring to a definition two-thirds used a single definition. The remaining articles referred to at least two definitions possibly meaning that maybe a traceability definition should not be taken for granted. The most common definition used was the one provided by the EU Regulation 178/2002 (European Commisssion 2002) which was followed in order by the definitions given by the international standards ISO 8402 (ISO 1994) and ISO 9000/ISO 22005 (ISO 2005). Moving further with their analysis the authors of this review show that all the definitions commonly referred to in these articles have weaknesses including the mostly used definition. However the definition provided by ISO 8402 is the one incorporating all the critical properties of a traceability system as described in the scientific literature. Nevertheless considering that this standard has been superseded the authors conclude that an ideal definition does not currently exist. By combining the best parts of the existing definitions Olsen and Borit (2013) offer a new possible definition of traceability that can potentially be applied to the traceability of any products not only food related: traceability (n.) is the ability to access any or all information relating to that which is under consideration throughout its entire life cycle by means of recorded identifications. Moving beyond the definition of traceability a review of the specialty literature indicates that the theoretical disagreement continues with the breadth of traceability (ie how much information should the traceability system record) its depth and granularity (ie how small should the unit identified by the system be) its coverage (ie the entire supply chain or only specific parts of it) and the regulatory body who should be responsible for implementing traceability (ie the law-making bodies or the industry). 2.2.2 Traceability and Data Validation and Verification Contrary to popular belief traceability is not a method to ensure that information about a certain product is true. Borit and Santos (2015) argue that traceability is an infrastructure that can be used by control agencies for retrieving different data for various reasons (such as quality problems) or for verifying these data with their specific means. As previously mentioned in the specialty literature �a traceability system is quite similar to a filing cabinet in that they both deal with systematic storing and retrieving of data. Importantly neither a traceability system nor a filing cabinet care about what types of data are being stored� (Olsen and Borit 2013). Thus error and fraud can make that the recordings are neither true nor complete. Therefore the need to verify these claims is obvious and here alongside thorough inspections and certification analytical methods play an important role (Kelly et al. 2011). 2.2.3 Traceability and Certification When analyzing food products� traceability it is important to notice that documenting traceability and documenting an eco-label type chain of custody are two different concepts. While being two different processes traceability can be used as a tool in the certification process. Documentation of chain of custody is part of what is required for certification especially certification related to the use of eco-labels. As explained in the specialty literature there are crucial differences between the two processes Advances in Food Traceability Techniques and Technologies : Improving Quality Throughout the Food Chain edited by  Montserrat Espi�eira and Francisco J Santaclara Elsevier Science & Technology 2016.

For example while traceability allows random splitting and joining of products as long as one documents the fact that the traceable units have been split up or joined together certification has stricter rules for the chain of custody requirements and traceable units from different suppliers should not be mixed. 2.2.4 Traceability and Transparency Transparency is a critical element in risk communication because it is directly linked to trust building among stakeholders (Hofstede 2004a; Renn 2008). Transparency of a supply chain is the degree of shared understanding of and access to productrelated information as requested by supply chain�s stakeholders without loss noise delay or distortion (Hofstede 2004a). Transparency does not equate to traceability because the latter only sets the framework for the former (Egels-Zand�n et al. 2014). Depending on whether transparency is aimed at the past present or future it can be divided into three types: history- operations- and strategy transparency (Hofstede 2004a). When it comes to products it can be said that traceability is a means of acquiring the first two types of transparency since it addresses the past and the present of the product. 3. The EU Food Legislation Until the outbreak of the BSE crisis (late 1980s) many of the Community�s rules relating to food safety regulation were mainly created on an ad hoc basis and/or developed in the jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice (Vos 2000). However this crisis was a major catalyst for change in the EU regulatory regime for food. After one green paper on food one white paper on the same matter and the dioxin contamination scandal it was decided to establish general principles of food law at the EU level to establish common definitions and to lay down overarching guiding principles and legitimate objectives for food law in order to ensure a high level of health protection (O�Rourke 2005). All these were included in the EC Regulation 178/2002 laying down the general principles and requirements of food law establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety usually referred to as the General Food Law (GFL). As a regulation this act was directly applicable in the legislation of the Member States without transposition. Separation of legislation from scientific consultation and from inspection thus leading to greater transparency are the general principles of this more coherent approach to food safety (Martinez and Epelbaum 2011; O�Rourke 2005). The GFL is the backbone of the new European food law and it is backed up by numerous other regulations and directives dealing with a multitude of food-related topics ranging from materials and articles intended to come into contact with food to food-and-feed products produced from genetically modified organisms (GMOs). For the untrained eye the entire EU body of food law at first sight might be perceived as an endless amount of provisions of a very technical and detailed nature (Meulen 2014).

Traceability in the EU Food Legislation 4.1 The General Food Law (GFL) Regulatory institutions in the EU attempted to restore consumer confidence in policy making and industry practices by introducing food and food ingredient traceability systems through the provisions of the GFL (Martinez and Epelbaum 2011). Recitals 28 and 29 of the GFL refer to the main driver of implementing traceability at the EU level ie enabling the identification of food safety problems at the source and across the food chain and the removal of unsafe food from the market: (28) Experience has shown that the functioning of the internal market in food or feed can be jeopardised where it is impossible to trace food and feed. It is therefore necessary to establish a comprehensive system of traceability within food and feed businesses so that targeted and accurate withdrawals can be undertaken or information given to consumers or control officials thereby avoiding the potential for unnecessary wider disruption in the event of food safety problems. (29) It is necessary to ensure that a food or feed business including an importer can identify at least the business from which the food feed animal or substance that may be incorporated into a food or feed has been supplied to ensure that on investigation traceability can be assured at all stages. The specific GFL provisions broaden the scope of traceability to all foods and food ingredients. Article 3 Paragraph 15 defines traceability as follows: �Traceability� means the ability to trace and follow a food feed food-producing animal or substance intended to be or expected to be incorporated into a food or feed through all stages of production processing and distribution. It is worth noting that food crises in the past have shown that tracing the commercial flow of a product by keeping invoices was not sufficient to follow the physical flow of that product. Therefore it is considered essential that the traceability system of each food business operator is designed to follow the physical flow of the products (EC 2010). Article 18 provides further details on how traceability can be achieved. Traceability  1. The traceability of food feed food-producing animals and any other substance intended to be or expected to be incorporated into a food or feed shall be established at all stages of production processing and distribution.  2. Food and feed business operators shall be able to identify any person from whom they have been supplied with a food a feed a food-producing animal or any substance intended to be or expected to be incorporated into a food or feed.

Food and feed business operators shall have in place systems and procedures to identify the other businesses to which their products have been supplied. This information shall be made available to the competent authorities on demand.  4. Food or feed which is placed on the market or is likely to be placed on the market in the Community shall be adequately labeled or identified to facilitate its traceability through relevant documentation or information in accordance with the relevant requirements of more specific provisions.  5. Provisions for the purpose of applying the requirements of this Article in respect of specific sectors may be adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 58(2). This article refers to �any substance intended to be or expected to be incorporated into a food or feed� as a part of a food or feed during its manufacture preparation or treatment. Furthermore the article applies to food business operators at all stages of the food/feed chain from primary production (food-producing animals harvests) and food/feed processing to distribution and supply including brokers regardless of whether they take physical possession of the food/feed in question. However the traceability provisions of the Regulation do not apply outside the EU (EC 2010). According to the text of Article 18 the legal requirements rely on the �one-step-back� and �one-step-forward� approach to traceability. This approach implies that food business operators have to establish two types of links: a link �supplier-product� (which products supplied from which suppliers) and a link �customer-product� (which products supplied to which customers). Nevertheless operators do not have to identify the immediate customers when they are the final consumers. The Regulation does not expressly constrain operators to establish a link �incoming and outgoing products� (so-called �internal traceability�). Thus there is no requirement for records to be kept identifying how product batches are split and combined within a business to create particular products or new batches (EC 2010). In other words businesses have to know where the ingredients came from and where the products went but not necessarily which ingredients went into which products (Meulen and Velde 2008). This specific approach is considered to be not effective by the specialty literature and it was proven so by the beef-horsemeat scandal in Europe when agricultural experts declared that �the lack of transparency and traceability is flagrant in regard to poultry pork and horsemeat� (Priscille 2013). The Regulation (EU) No 931/2011 of September 19 2011 on the traceability requirements set by GFL (Europan Commission 2011) tries to improve this situation by adding several details to the list of information that has to be kept by food operators. However following the methodological approach for evaluation of regulatory requirements related to data recording and traceability(Borit and Olsen 2012; Borit and Santos 2015) this present study considers that even with this new addition the GFL approach to traceability is still not effective. Arguing that Article 18 of GFL is worded in terms of its goal and intended result rather than in terms of prescribing how that result is to be achieved the European Commission is nevertheless acknowledging that �an internal traceability system would contribute to more targeted and accurate withdrawals.

This in turn would help maintain consumer confidence. [�] It would also be very helpful if details are kept of any reference or batch number enabling the product to be identified� (EC 2010). The legislature considers that �this more general approach allows industry greater flexibility in the implementation of the requirement and is thus likely to reduce compliance costs. However it requires both food businesses and the control authorities to take an active role in ensuring effective implementation� (EC 2010). In this case the question that arises is whether the businesses and the control authorities are indeed taking this active role. In conclusion the main aim of implementing traceability though GFL is facilitating rapid identification of the source of a food safety issue in order to conduct aimed recalls that take faulty products out of the market. However in practice traceability systems are used for other purposes as well. As indicated in Section 2.2.2 these systems can be used as an infrastructure enabling retrieval of data for various purposes such as assessing certain invisible qualities related to their origin or the way the products have been handled (eg organic). The traceability requirements of GFL are general requirements and are therefore always applicable (EC 2010). 4.2 Other Legislation Several other EU rules among which are the ones regulating the trade in fish and fish products or sprouts and seeds intended for the production of sprouts impose traceability systems similar to the GFL one. However for some specific products that proved to pose safety problems in the past such as beef eggs and items produced from GMOs more specific requirements apply which go beyond the �one-step-back� and�one-step-forward� approach and implement at least from a legislative point of view an effective traceability system (Borit and Santos 2015). The same holds true for the new rules for identification of Equidae (Regulation 2015/262 (European Commission 2015)). This new rule was drawn in the aftermath of the beef-horsemeat scandal when it was observed that the mislabeled beef was traced back to its original supplier due to the effective traceability implemented in the beef sector but because of the noneffective traceability of the horsemeat sector the origin of this meat could not be identified (Priscille 2013). In the case of products that make very specific claims such as organic products the legislative approach is somewhere in between the GFL one and this very strict one (Borit and Santos 2015). Besides food safety these rules might have different drivers for the implementation of traceability in the specific food chains. One example is rules having environmental sustainability as the main driver such as Regulation 1005/2008 on deterring and eliminating illegal unreported and unregulated fishing (European Commission 2008). Another example is rules that reassure that traceability is also meant to facilitate attribution of responsibility (eg liability) such as Regulation 1935/2004 on materials and articles intended to come in contact with food (European Commission 2004). Whether this possibility is considered an advantage or a disadvantage depends on the position of the actor in the food chain. As noted in the literature for business at the end of the food chain compared with those further upstream it seems advantageous for liability to be passed to the actors where the problem originated (Meulen and Velde 2008).

Consistency of the EU Body of Law Related to Traceability and Future Trends As it is clear from the analysis performed in Section 4 the EU food law related to traceability lacks interpolicy horizontal consistency. This conclusion is in line with the results of a systematic review of legislation that analyzed the EU body of law related to traceability in the supply chain of 16 groups of products (including nonfood ones) (Borit and Santos 2015). Following the same line of thought according to Lavelli (2013) the EU legislature works with two different models when it comes to food traceability. The one implemented through the application of the GFL leads to a generic (nonspecific) low-warranty traceability of the food supply chain. A second more complex model is followed in rules regulating products such as those derived from GMO. The application of this second model leads to a specific high-warranty traceability system for any product unit in the food supply chain. Naming both these opposite models as traceability can have negative consequences as both the legislature and the consumers could develop a false sense of security and thus hinder further action in the form of research and effective new legislation in the field (Borit and Santos 2015). In addition the public trust can be shaken if the authorities cannot rely on the current rules in order to perform quick and accurate recalls of faulty products as in the beef-horsemeat scandal. It is interesting to analyze if there is a trend in how the EU legislature approaches traceability in order to understand the rationale behind the inconsistent choice between the two models and to be able to forecast how future legislation will tackle the matter. A recent study concluded that these approaches are strongly correlated with the original driver for risk management (eg human safety or concern for environmental sustainability) moderately correlated with the type of goods involved (eg low-technology or high-technology products) and uncorrelated with their trade value (Borit and Santos 2015). These results are validated by the preference of the legislature for the high-warranty effective model when implementing the Tobacco Products Directive 2014/40/EU. Safeguarding human safety was the focus when formulating this rule as annually around 700000 people die in the EU due to illness related to tobacco usage (Europan Commission 2014). Thus it is expected that food-related legislation implementing traceability because of environmental issues would fall short of effectiveness. 6. Conclusions In the aftermath of several food scandals the EU decided to implement new legal rules related to food supply chains and traceability was chosen as a management tool to safeguard human safety and other claims such as environmental sustainability and product quality. However the body of law dealing with this matter is considered to be inconsistent as the approach to traceability implementation varies from product to product depending on the answers to the questions �why Advances in Food Traceability Techniques and Technologies : Improving Quality Throughout the Food Chain edited by  Montserrat Espi�eira and Francisco J Santaclara Elsevier Science & Technology 2016.

On a more profound level the multiple perceptions about the meaning and applicability of traceability held by different people and different legislatures may be related to idiosyncratic cultural backgrounds and therefore to their basic notions of trust and transparency requirements (Hofstede 2004b). However regardless these aspects a traceability system is considered good when it delivers accurate information in a fast manner (EC 2010). This study asks whether the current food legislation uses the best available models in order to set the implementation basis of good traceability systems regardless of the food product and traceability drivers.

Borit et al: Representations of Colonialism in Three Popular Modern Board Games 2 Introduction With all its intricate processes colonialism both as an ideology and a historical period has been a rich source of inspiration for contemporary popular culture whether in the form of movies novels digital games or analogue games. The popularity of digital games has triggered considerable academic effort into analysing how these popular culture artefacts touch upon issues that are related directly or indirectly to colonial themes and the ways in which these games construct various conceptions of space race identity political systems ethics and society through historical re-enactment and representations (Brock 2011; Chapman 2016; Hammar 2017; Higgin 2008; Lammes 2010; Langer 2008; Magnet 2006; Martin 2016; Mukherjee 2016; Poor 2012; Vrtacic 2014; Young 2016). However despite several publications in outlets such as the open-access journal Analog Game Studies this popular trend has yet to be matched by academic literature in the board games (tabletop or analogue games) domain (Wilson 2015); something that is all the more important given the growing size of this segment of the market (Jolin 2016). This article aims to contribute to the endeavour of addressing this gap in scholarly literature on board games and critically analyses colonial representations in three simulation Eurogames of the strategy type: Puerto Rico (2002) (Figure 1) Struggle of Empires (2004) (Figure 2) and Archipelago (2012) (Figure 3).

Borit et al: Representations of Colonialism in Three Popular Modern Board Games 3 three games are in top three-hundred overall with more than 3000 votes each (date of visit: 25.04.2017). Our comparative analysis investigates the denotative and connotative meanings of game rules game mechanics artwork and tiles. Players assimilate the mechanics physical elements and narratives that games employ to construct believable characters and worlds; and thus they willingly believe in the interactive fictions presented to them during gameplay (Brock 2011) opening up a realm of personal meaning (Wilson 2015). Therefore it is important to critically assess to what extent these board games are instrumental in preserving perpetuating and disseminating the colonial mind-set and power structures among a contemporary audience. Building on John McLeod�s definition of colonialism and interpretation of Figure 2: Instance of playing Struggle of Empires. Source: Flickr.com. Figure 3: Instance of playing Archipelago.

Borit et al: Representations of Colonialism in Three Popular Modern Board Games 4 colonial economies (McLeod 2010) Edward Said�s theory of Orientalism (Said 2003) and Gayatri Spivak�s theory of subalternity (Spivak 1996) this article comparatively explores how these three games construct representations of: otherness of colonial subjects in relation with the colonisers; indigenous peoples� agency and subaltern voice; expressions of the indigenous culture; and Eurocentrism. If indeed games are places of informal daily experience �sites for identity formation and meaning-making as well as complex problem solving� (Steinkuehler 2005: Page 12.) then what kind of identity is the player forming when solving problems raised while playing these three games and what kind of meaning making? While most articles of this type analyse one game only we have chosen to look at and compare three different games. In our view this is the optimal number of games which enables us to produce a rich comparative analysis without overloading the reader with too many examples to follow through the analysis. The main reasons for this choice are as follows: � One of our aims is to investigate if there might be commonalities between these games and this is easier to accomplish if we describe and analyse several games simultaneously using the same framework and methodology. � Another aim is to investigate if there might be trends or systematic differences between the games. To identify trends we need to examine games released over a substantial period of time. Ten years have passed since the release of Puerto Rico to the more recent release of Archipelago and much has happened in the board gaming world in those years; both with respect to the number and type of games released the artwork and production value of these games and the underlying mechanics of the games. � Since 2005 more than 1000 new board games have been added annually to the BoardGameGeek database. With the advent of crowd-funding and progressively lower costs required to achieve high production values this number is ever increasing and there are now more than 87000 games in the database. If we want to subject the realm of board gaming to a literary analysis it seems desirable to look at a few games at a time so that we can Borit et al: Representations of Colonialism in Three Popular Modern Board Games 5 increase the representativeness and the fraction of games studied while still keeping the amount of detail within comprehensible limits. The games chosen were selected based on the arguments indicated above. We wanted games that offer a strong colonial theme which could be studied as representative of colonial-themed games in general were released over a substantial period of time were popular and of course available (and fun to play). Most board gamers would probably consider Puerto Rico (Seyfarth 2002) to be the classic colonial game (with its fair share of political incorrectness) and it was therefore the first game that we selected. Archipelago (Boelinger 2012) is a newer game and was the second game selected for this study. Puerto Rico and Archipelago are both resource management/ economic optimisation games which encourage players to develop and manage a system of production distribution trade and/or consumption of goods. If we wanted to represent colonial-themed board games we clearly needed an area control game (in which players have to establish their authority over a territory in the game) and/or a direct conflict game (in which players are encouraged to engage their game characters in battles). Struggle of Empires (Wallace 2004) was chosen to represent both these large sub-sets of colonial-themed games; partly because it satisfied all the criteria indicated above and partly because the game also contains mechanics specific to a colonial setting (including the East Indies Company government reform slave revolt etc.) that can be compared with the other two games. The Games: Objectives and Main Elements To understand the relationship between colonialism Orientalism and subalternity; and the three board games we chose for analysis it is necessary first to describe these games and familiarise the reader with their settings and main elements. Puerto Rico Struggle of Empires and Archipelago are Eurogames (i.e. they emphasise strategy over luck and conflict [Woods 2012]) with rules designed to emulate and reproduce two time periods: first-wave European colonialism (Puerto Rico; Archipelago) and 18th-century European colonial expansion (Struggle of Empires). A summary of the main aspects of these games is provided in Table 1.

The games recorded in BoardgameGeek.com can be searched thematically and a search for �Colonial Theme� yields fourty-four games however it should be noted that there are far more games than this if we include colonialism in terms of games� fictional or futuristic settings. A relevant question to ask at this stage is whether the three board games chosen for analysis in this study are actually about colonialism or whether the game mechanic (i.e. methods invoked by agents designed for interaction with the game state; for example turn taking or tile-laying [Sicart 2008]) is the main focus in the game the theme being more or less arbitrary and added late in the process (it could have been basically anything that fit the mechanic). In other words the question is whether the main objective of the game designer was to build a game featuring a specific mechanic (e.g. tile-laying) regardless of the theme (e.g. alien invasion detectives zombies) or to feature a theme (e.g. alien invasion) regardless of the mechanic (e.g. tile-laying dice turns). There are two ways of investigating this � either by trusting the judgement of experienced board gamers who have played literally hundreds of games of different types or by asking the designer. Out of the dozens of games we could have chosen from for our analysis one selection criterion used to identify these three games was the subjective feeling of a �strong� theme where the mechanics in the game seemed subservient to the theme. It is often possible to identify games where parts of the game mechanic obviously have no real-life counterpart in the game setting; this is not the case for any of these three games. All the actions and options in all these games seem to match a real-life situation or action relevant in a colonial setting. We do not have access to the thoughts of the designers for all these games but for Puerto Rico the highest ranked among the three games under discussion there are interviews with the designer Andreas Seyfarth that shed some light on this matter. He says the following: Andreas: [I released] Puerto Rico in 2001. This game had a developing time of about 15 years (from the first ideas until production). Borit et al: Representations of Colonialism in Three Popular Modern Board Games 14 Question: When first designing a game do you start with the theme or the mechanics? Andreas: I always start with the theme. Andreas: For Puerto Rico lots of development chains merged. One of them was the idea to do something in the new world and build up an economy. (Vasel 2005) Simulating simplified mechanisms of colonial reality the three games chosen for analysis in this study have clear objectives to be fulfilled by the players. In all these  games the player has the same perspective that of a colonist and has to choose among performing similar activities across the games activities that seem to be common to Eurogames featuring a colonial theme: harvest natural resources manage populations build trade expand and conquer. Nevertheless it is important to note that both fictional cultural expressions such as board games and allegedly factual ones such as historiographic documentaries offer only representations of the past and do not reflect historical realities as such (Hammar 2017). That said we have to add that at least in a digital context there are games with a colonial theme that cast the player in the role of the colonised (Hammar 2017). As a side note following Elizabeth LaPens�e�s refreshing approach to game design which advocates for �culturally responsive gameplay meaning gameplay that is drawn from and that uplifts the cultures involved� it would be interesting to see board games on the theme of colonialism with different mechanics than the ones mentioned above possibly mechanics such as �collaboration stewardship generosity and gratitude� (LaPens�e 2016: n. pag.). In Puerto Rico (2002) the player�s aim is to collect victory points by producing goods that can be traded or shipped to Europe or by constructing buildings. Thus Puerto Rico is a simplistic resource management and optimisation game. The player takes a card indicating a leader role each round (Prospector Captain Mayor Trader Settler Craftsman or Builder). To activate and own farms or own buildings the player needs a number of the small black discs that come into the game each round. In the game rules these are referred to as �colonists� but in practice and from Borit et al: Representations of Colonialism in Three Popular Modern Board Games 15 the historical background it is clear that these discs represent slaves and this aspect has been heavily criticised by the international community of board gamers (Hodge 2011; Larson 2012) (the persons represented by the discs have minor supporting roles the player/leader decides where they go and they do the actual work in buildings or farms). In addition there are no mechanisms in the game for slowing down growth or penalties for extracting resources too quickly or using �colonists� too intensively. There are numerous exchanges in various discussion forums pointing out how politically incorrect the game is and some players feel uncomfortable with the game for this reason. However this game is one of the most popular board games being ranked in the top fifteen games worldwide (see Table 1). Struggle of Empires (2004) focuses more on war as a phenomenon associated with colonialism. As the presentation on the box of the game describes the game recreates: the various wars fought between European powers as they attempt to become the dominant force in Europe and the rest of the world during the eighteenth century. Build armies and fleets make alliances establish colonies improve your economy and ultimately wage war to expand your empire. Be careful though as a profligate country can end up being consumed by revolution. (Game box presentation [Wallace 2004]) Struggle of Empires is thus an area control game with a fairly strong colonial theme. While it is certainly Eurocentric the areas over which the players fight for domination are in Europe as well as various colonial regions around the world. In contrast with the other two games there are no explicit resources (except money) � victory points are generated by controlling the various European countries and colonies. The game mechanic is more advanced than we find for instance in Puerto Rico and there are trade-offs to consider. If the player sends colony ships out to sea the population in the player�s home country decreases with a potentially adverse effect on national unrest which it is important to keep at a relatively low level. In addition to population loss in the home country colonisation is risky in that ships can be lost on the way Borit et al: Representations of Colonialism in Three Popular Modern Board Games 16 or the player can suffer �Pirates� �Slave revolt� or �Blockade�; these are negative game effects that other players can inflict on each other and they only apply in colonies. Compared with Puerto Rico Struggle of Empires is not a simplistic optimisation game with nothing to limit the player�s growth. Unpopular decisions will increase the player�s unrest level so each player has to weigh options and risk carefully. In Archipelago (2012) the game rules are described as follows: Each player portrays an explorer and his team commissioned by a European nation to discover colonize and exploit islands. The mission is intended to be one of peace: to meet the needs of the local population while providing commercial returns to the continent. The archipelago and its natives must be treated fairly or they will rebel [�] A balance must be found between expansionism and humanism between commercial goals and respect for local values between knowledge sharing and unbridled industrialization. Such a balance can only be achieved through each player�s commitment to make the archipelago a happy and productive colony. (Game rules [Boelinger 2012]) Archipelago is the most advanced of these three games both in game mechanics and as a simulation of colonisation in general. The whole game takes place in the colonies and while the player starts the game with two �citizens� on his/her own ship he/she gradually incorporates the people he/she meets on various islands and there is no difference between the original (European) citizens and the new inhabitants. An important mechanic is that of �Rebellion level�: unpopular actions by any player (e.g. levelling taxation on citizens) increases this value. If the level of rebellion gets too high the island population revolts the game ends immediately and everyone loses (except if the �Separatist� is in play; see below). Another major difference between Archipelago and the other two games is that all the players here have different goals drawn randomly at the start of the gameplay and kept secret. �Pacifist� is one possible goal: if a player draws this card then his/her goal is to have a large total population on the islands and to keep them happy with a very low Borit et al: Representations of Colonialism in Three Popular Modern Board Games 17 rebellion level. �Separatist� is another goal: in this instance the player must secretly side with the rebels in the native population and not cooperate in the other (colonial) players� measures to keep the native population happy. If the revolt happens the player secretly playing as a Separatist immediately wins the game. There are also more standard secret goals relating to money or resources so it is important to pay attention to what fellow players are doing. This in addition to fairly advanced mechanisms for modelling population developments unemployment level and variable price in local and export markets means that Archipelago comes closer to simulating actual colonisation in that these processes historically existed and had to be taken into consideration by colonial administrations when making key decisions concerning governance. Playing the Colonist As Emil Hammar explains and in line with historical theory (White 1984) �narrative and discourse serve as constitutive elements of history and it is through these that individuals and collectives form their understanding of the past� (Hammar 2017: 373). Game players are both receivers and users of the discourse employed by the game. As Hall points out: Anyone deploying a discourse must position themselves as if they were the subject of the discourse. For example we may not ourselves believe in the natural superiority of the West. But if we use the discourse of �the West and the Rest� we will necessarily find ourselves speaking from a position that holds that the West is a superior civilization. (Hall 2007: 202) The question that any player of Puerto Rico Struggle of Empires or Archipelago might ask himself or herself is: what position is he or she speaking from while playing these games; therefore what kind of discourse do these games employ? Western modernity is often linked with the territorial and cultural expansion of European powers in the �newly discovered� overseas territories even though such �acts of discovery only differed accidentally from other voyages and were expressions of an imperial design� (Carter 2010: Page xviii.). The European colonial project is described Borit et al: Representations of Colonialism in Three Popular Modern Board Games 18 in relation to two key concepts: imperialism and capitalism (Young 2001; McLeod 2010). On the one hand even though colonialism is sometimes used interchangeably with imperialism McLeod suggests that there is a clear distinction between these concepts with colonialism being �one form of practice one modality of control which results from the ideology of imperialism and it specifically concerns the settlement of people in a new location� (McLeod 2010: 9; our emphasis). On the other hand Young explains that colonialism functioned as an activity on the periphery of the empire economically driven and sometimes hard to control from the perspective of the home government whereas imperialism �operated from the centre as a policy of state driven by the grandiose projects of power� (Young 2001: 17). Thus colonialism implies more than just a historical periodisation and a territorial delineation. The complexity of the phenomenon is comprehensively captured in the definition provided by Elleke Boehmer in her influential book Colonial and Postcolonial Literature: Migrant Metaphors (1995) which describes colonialism as �the settlement of territory the exploitation and development of resources and the attempt to govern the indigenous inhabitants of occupied lands often by force� (Boehmer 2005: 2). This threefold depiction of colonialism casts the focus on the social-political dimension of colonisation as a process of settlement and implementation of an administrative system based on unequal relations of power between the coloniser and the indigenous peoples and equally emphasises its economic component which was the spread of capitalism. In Empire: The British Imperial Experience from 1765 to the Present (1997) Denis Judd similarly foregrounds the economic foundation of colonialism: �[n]o one can doubt that the desire for profitable trade plunder and enrichment was the primary force that led to the establishment of the imperial structure� (Judd 1996: 3). Seizing foreign territories populating them with colonists and developing an administrative apparatus were actions motivated by the desire to establish new markets; and to exploit natural resources and the labour force at the lowest possible cost for the European powers. In this context it is relevant to add Robert Young�s distinction between the two main forms of colonisation: one motivated by the desire for living space one by the extraction of riches (Young 2001). Thus Young distinguishes between two distinct kinds of colonies: the settled and the exploited which would be Borit et al: Representations of Colonialism in Three Popular Modern Board Games 19 treated very differently. The former kind led ultimately to self-governing dominions such as South Africa Australia or New Zealand whereas the latter �tended to develop into the exploitative situation of domination colonies� (Young 2001: 19). As Miguel Sicart suggests game mechanics facilitate and encourage players to explore and modify environments (2008: n. pag.). These mechanics function also as cultural mechanisms allowing the players of games � such as the three games under discussion here � to probe transform and push the limits of colonial spatial transformations (Lammes 2010). Puerto Rico Struggle of Empires and Archipelago are clearly re-enacting manifestations of colonialism. Through their mechanics these games engage the players in the three basic activities specific to this phenomenon as described by Boehmer (2005): settling territories (for example the Greater Antilles in the Caribbean Sea; the entire world; and an archipelago that the game implies is located in the Caribbean Sea respectively); exploiting and developing the local resources (raw materials and agricultural production in all three games including slaves in Struggle of Empires and the local population in Archipelago); attempting to govern the settled territories (all three games) and the local population (in Struggle of Empires and Archipelago). As such these three games do not distinguish between the two kinds of colonies identified by Young and the colonies depicted in them are both settled and exploited. In all these three games players� empathy and engagement are constantly directed towards exclusive identification with the coloniser and never with the colonised (even though this latter option could have engaged the players in a �potentially cathartic power fantasy within a historical struggle� as explained by Hammar [2017]). Re-enactment of colonial values is facilitated by granting access to familiar assets (e.g. plantations raw materials ports missionary churches) and instruments (e.g. markets diplomatic service colonial administration) that contribute to achievement of colonial objectives while incentives can be economical and political thus motivating the player to achieve goals that are familiar to the Eurocentric mind-set. The coloniser�s main goal in each game is to gain political economic and cultural dominance in the colonies. To justify the coloniser�s venture colonisation is depicted as a necessary intervention to save the colonies from their economic and cultural Borit et al: Representations of Colonialism in Three Popular Modern Board Games 20 backwardness. If economic underdevelopment is implied in the gameplay of all three games by the systematic exploitation of raw materials and of agriculture as well as the introduction of incipient industrial facilities (e.g. the sugar mill in Puerto Rico) and incorporation of the colony into the circuit of global trade (e.g. companies all over the world in Struggle of Empires) actual cultural backwardness is only deployed in Archipelago. In this game the player can build amphitheatres where locals are depicted mainly as performers with the consequence of reducing the level of rebellion among the natives and increasing cultural values. The player can also build cathedrals with the same consequence of reducing the level of rebellion. By contrast the discovery of a pyramid (which represents the epitome of authentic local culture and is ironically enough the only such symbol in the entire game) costs the player stone resources. This implies that these natural physical resources belonged a priori to the colonisers rather than the indigenous inhabitants and has the consequence of substantially increasing the level of rebellion among the natives. Meeting the Other For the purpose of saving the colonies from their own �backwardness� the coloniser creates through discourse a convenient image about the colony an image that entails the superiority of the �West over the Rest� to use Stuart Hall�s parlance (Hall 2007: 221). In order to scrutinise these three games� presentations of colonial reality we are grounding our analysis of Puerto Rico Struggle of Empires and Archipelago in Edward Said�s theory of Orientalism formulated in the book of the same name in 1978 (Said 2003). Despite been criticised by scholars such as Aijaz Ahmad in Orientalism and After (1992) Sadik Jalal al-Azm in Orientalism and Orientalism in Reverse (1980) and more recently Ibn Warraq in Defending the West (2009) Said�s theory has been consistently employed in analysing board games in specialist literature on game studies (Faidutti 2017; Foasberg 2016; Trammell 2016). Said�s approach to theorising Orientalism supports the binary opposition between what he has termed as �the familiar (Europe the West �us�) and the strange (the Orient the East �them�)� (Said 2003: 44). According to this conceptualisation the West has developed a self-defining identification mechanism that builds on the perpetual Borit et al: Representations of Colonialism in Three Popular Modern Board Games 21 antithesis between the Orient as being everything the West is not: �its contrasting image idea personality experience� (Said 2003: 2) its alter ego and ultimately an epitome of the Other. For Said the West needed to build such an image of the Orient which �in a sense created and then served the two worlds thus conceived� (Said 2003: 43) in order to justify its position of superiority within the power structures that colonialism endorsed. Orientalism is therefore according to Said�s perspective �a set of discursive practices the forms of power-knowledge that Western cultures used to produce (and hence control) a region of the globe known as the Orient� (Klages 2006: 153). This convenient image of the colony being an antithesis of the world the player represents is conveyed in the three games through similar methods. For example presenting the colonised world as an empty space (as in Puerto Rico which recalls The Settlers of Catan [Teuber 1995] another very popular board game [LoringAlbright 2015]) or terra nullius �with not a native or a slave to be seen� (Foasberg 2016: n. pag.); or as a scarcely populated territory (as in Archipelago) waiting to be discovered (�as if a country which has not been named or brought into cultural circulation can in any sense be said to have been discovered� [Carter 2010: xviii]) exploited and managed by the expanding European powers. Similarly the local production of raw materials and goods; and the local governance structure are depicted as primitive compared with the technology and structures introduced by the colonists; the local culture has opposite effects on the locals than the culture of the colonist has on them (e.g. in Archipelago a pyramid the symbol of the local culture increases rebellion level while a cathedral the symbol of the colonist culture decreases it). Another strategy of colonial world-building employed by each game establishes the colonists as educated and in possession of highly qualified jobs (e.g. explorers clergy or merchants in Archipelago; military officers and experts in Struggle of Empire) whereas the colonised populations work in more menial and less qualified occupations (e.g. primary production and the extraction of raw materials). Thus through the process of hegemony i.e. the �production of meaning as a key instrument for the stabilization of power relations� (J�rgensen & Phillips 2002: 32) the colonised populations are discursively constructed as a marginalised Borit et al: Representations of Colonialism in Three Popular Modern Board Games 22 group; either left out of mass-cultural depictions of the past (as in Puerto Rico) or relegated to banal representations of their own culture and identity (as in Struggle of Empire and Archipelago) and thus excluded from attaining any form of recognition within these games� processes of cultural memory (Hammar 2017). This practice of problematic representation of European expansionism in which the indigenous other is marginalised exploited and silenced has been noticed also in other Eurogames (Robinson 2014). The history of colonialism is a history of discourses about colonised territories. Said claims that the discursive creation of the colonised Other also serves to silence the colonised culture by obstructing communication between the ruler and the subaltern thus rejecting the latter�s right to �talk back� (Said 2003: 95). In the colonial system the coloniser solely assumes the privilege of �speaking� or employing discourse in order to establish the logic of a binary opposition between self and other hence between self and subaltern. Originally introduced by the Italian Marxist theorist Antonio Gramsci the concept of the subaltern was transferred in the 1980s into the field of colonial and postcolonial studies by a group of prominent Indian scholars known as the Subaltern Studies Group. In the essay �Can the Subaltern Speak?� Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak a member of this group scrutinises the possibility of bilateral employment of discourse and concludes that in any relation of power and implicitly �in the context of colonial production the subaltern has no history and cannot speak� (Spivak 1996: 41). Spivak attaches particular significance to the term speak which implies an ambivalent transaction of meaning from a speaker to a receiver: �By �speaking� I was obviously talking about a transaction between the speaker and the listener� (Spivak 1996: 293). This act of communication is distorted in the colonial context since the colonist is not willing to listen to what the subaltern might have to say. The social disparity that informs colonial society negates the possibility of the subaltern �talk[ing] back�. The subaltern concludes Spivak has no voice and the only valid discourse available to use is that of the coloniser. Radhika Gajjala proposes a definition of the subaltern as a colonial subject that is in line with Spivak�s critique. She depicts the subaltern as an �individual who does Borit et al: Representations of Colonialism in Three Popular Modern Board Games 23 not have the tools or the agency to actively and freely participate in a social order [and] the subaltern is also deemed as not to have the voice to speak for her/himself� (Gajjala 2013: 29). Gajiala�s definition is contextualised in a digital context and as Souvik Mukherjee suggests �how far this definition applies to postcolonial elements in game cultures is a moot question� (Mukherjee 2015: 10). However we consider Gajiala�s definition of the subaltern to be an accurate depiction of the colonial subaltern represented in the board games under analysis in this study: as a subject denied the possibility of talking about her/himself and forced to communicate in a language that is discursively loaded in favour of the coloniser the subaltern populations in Puerto Rico Struggle of Empires and Archipelago are therefore cast into a binary opposition that condemns them to be silent and powerless which colonial discourse promotes in order to ensure its own ideological reproduction. Even though the privilege of speaking and the voice of the subaltern are depicted differently in the three games included in this study it seems that in Spivak�s terms the subaltern is suppressed within the game�s rules � something that we find in other games including within a digital context (see for example Ford 2016; Mukherjee 2016). In Puerto Rico the indigenous population is completely absent. The world is populated only by colonists who arrive from the metropolitan centres by ship and settle into the new world with the support of the administrator (i.e. the Mayor) fitting into the freshly colonised society in accordance with labour force needs. Thus the subaltern who from a historical point of view had inhabited the Greater Antilles prior to colonisation is excluded from the re-enactment of this colonial reality. To use Spivak�s critical parlance it has no voice within the simulated historical world of the game. The situation is slightly different in Struggle of Empires where the colonised subaltern is physically represented through non-player characters and in the artwork. The African colonies are exclusively portrayed as a source of slaves whereas the other colonies (e.g. East Indies Caribbean South America) are depicted as a source of natural resources (e.g. gold in South America) trade partners (e.g. East Indies Company) allies (e.g. the Native Americans in North America or Indian Nawab in India) or military-trained natives. The agency of the subaltern is therefore Borit et al: Representations of Colonialism in Three Popular Modern Board Games 24 implicit in the game mechanics of Struggle of Empires. The colonised subjects in this game can function as allies and help the player fight other players. At certain points in the game�s development (e.g. loss of army units money shortage) unrest levels may increase but it is not clear if the unrest is manifest among the colonised population or among the colonists. Levels of unrest can be decreased by playing the Government Reform tile or the Industry tile. The equivocal character of the unrest can be interpreted as a form of voicing the subaltern if we assume that the colonised populations are rebelling against the colonial administration. A clearer form of voicing the colonised subaltern is represented by the possibility of slaves carrying out a rebellion against the colonial administration. This possibility is facilitated by the Slave Revolt tile. However we would argue that this represents a form of false agency since the player himself/herself and not a slave non-player-character enacts the slave revolt by choosing to buy the tile and deploying it against fellow players. A more straightforward mode of subaltern agency is included in Archipelago where the natives� rebellion emerges through gameplay and has a decisive effect on the game�s outcome (i.e. the archipelago claims its independence and the game ends with all players losing the game). Thus rebellion level (i.e. the level of discontent and frustration on the islands) rises with an increase in the number of surplus workers; the discovery of a pyramid; or playing the Barbarian Thief Assassin Pirate or Dictatorship cards. The rebellion level decreases by building churches or amphitheatres or playing the cards Gifts from the Clergy Bishop Archbishop Cathedral Peace & Prosperity. Overall the delineation of natives� agency in these three games suggests the enduring power of a colonial and Eurocentric perspective in which the Other is �only allowed visibility in very specific and calculated moments that enact the desires of the dominant audience and fit into their cultural imaginary� (Higgin 2008: 7). The two games that do actually include representations of the colonised population (Struggle of Empires and Archipelago) contain scarce depictions of indigenous culture. Struggle of Empires uses stereotypical illustrations of clothes and occupations through artwork (see the box cover for example which is available at https://boardgamegeek.com/ boardgame/9625/struggle-empires). The same technique is employed in Archipelago Borit et al: Representations of Colonialism in Three Popular Modern Board Games 25 but this is supplemented by images of native residences sanctuaries adornments totems and ritual body paintings in the game rules booklet for example. The considerations mentioned above reflect upon the topic of the subaltern�s voice within each of the game(s) under discussion. In future research it would be interesting to analyse whether the subaltern has a voice outside these game(s) i.e. to critically consider who is producing the game who is being given a platform to speak by making this game and who is involved in formalising the game mechanics and themes. Who is the Other? According to Stuart Hall there are two key features of the discourse of �the Other� (Hall 2007: 205). The first is stereotyping; i.e. several characteristics are collapsed into one simplified figure that stands for or represents the essence of the people; for example all the colonists are enterprising capitalist agents that can achieve prosperity in Puerto Rico whilst all the Africans are slaves in Struggle of Empires or all the indigenous people can be tamed by the Christian Church in Archipelago. The second feature describes how the discursive formation of the Other divides the stereotype into two halves � its �good� and �bad� sides; this is referred to as �splitting� or dualism. The reductionist representation of the colonised is one major artifice that is connected to the colonial discourse its purpose being that of pinning down the identity of the colonised in the form of stereotypes. In so doing the colonial discourse produces the colonised as �a social reality which is at once �other� and yet entirely knowable and visible� (Bhabha 2004: 70). In colonial discourse the process of constructing stereotypes establishes a unilateral depiction of reality a form of power imposed through discourse that excludes the colonial subject from negotiating his or her own identity. In other words the colonised subject is a voiceless subaltern within the asymmetrical power structure of colonialism inextricably projected in the simplified binaries that this structure promotes. In Hall�s perspective: �the world is first divided symbolically into good-bad us-them attractivedisgusting civilised-uncivilised the West-the Rest. All the other many differences between and within these two halves are collapsed simplified � i.e. stereotyped� (Hall 2007: 216). Borit et al: Representations of Colonialism in Three Popular Modern Board Games 26 He continues his critique of the colonial gaze over colonial subjects by asserting that: The question of how the natives and nations of the New World should be treated in the evolving colonial system was directly linked to the question of what sort of people and societies they were � which in turn depended on the West�s knowledge of them on how they were represented. Where did the Indians stand in the order of the Creation? Where were their nations placed in the order of civilized societies? Were they �true men� [sic]? Were they made in God�s image? (Hall 2007: 216) Following this line of reasoning as Brock explains �race stands in for cultural evil� (Brock 2011: Page 442.) with colonised subjects depicted as wild strange primitive and unfamiliar; and triggering discomfort and distress on the part of the coloniser. Giroux (1996) notes that �whiteness represents itself as a universal marker for being civilised and in doing so posits the Other within the language of pathology fear madness and degeneration� (Giroux 1996: 75). This is visible in the artwork of Archipelago in which the rebellious natives are portrayed as savage and barbarian with violent facial expressions and fearsome body painting: a performative display of their indigenous power designed to express dissatisfaction in the direction of the colonial administrator. By contrast the coloniser is illustrated through the familiar countenance and attitude of a European i.e. a white man who exhibits restraint a composed comportment and supposedly �civilised� countenance. The game nevertheless introduces several white non-player characters that display traces of degeneration such as the Thief and the Assassin. Players of Archipelago are invariably invited to identify with the white race as the roles the player can take (see Table 1) are inspired by a typical proto-European geography. This is part of the colonial ideological project to create a European mythology meant to justify colonisation. In the world depicted in the three games we are analysing such mythology is perpetuated within the contemporary Western ethos rather than inviting the player to engage in a critical reflexive conceptualisation of the colonial history being portrayed in this world. Control � over the self and the Borit et al: Representations of Colonialism in Three Popular Modern Board Games 27 spirit over women�s bodies (e.g. reproduction of natives in Archipelago) over land (e.g. expansion of crops in Puerto Rico) and over others (e.g. taming of rebels through government reform in Struggle of Empires or through church in Archipelago) � is a hallmark of white identity (Dyer 1997); standing in sharp antithesis to the games� depiction of natives� lack of control � over self (e.g. irascibility which is reflected in the �unrest level� in Struggle of Empires) women�s bodies (e.g. they do not decide themselves when to reproduce in Archipelago) and land (all three games). This ideologically constructed and yet naturalised representation of European coloniser and indigenous colonial subject is an important point to raise in considering how games such as the ones we analyse here enact control or lack of it as an integral part of the gaming experience. Stereotypes are not entirely produced through text or representation but are also suggested via the selective presence or absence of ethnicities (Higgin 2008). The omission of native characters from the discourse in Puerto Rico for example thus diminishes the potential of the game to provide balanced racial experience because it reinforces dominant notions of colonised subjects as negligible agents in the colonising process. �Stereotypes� as Jessica Langer notes �have the effect of creating a narrative or aesthetic shortcut to the desired player reaction� (Langer 2008: 91) which is in line with Homi Bhabha�s assertion that stereotyping is a method of making otherness �safe� and comfortable for the coloniser (Bhabha 2004: 116): in our case the player who inhabits and represents the colonial mind-set. Of course stereotypes are a widely employed method in designating people and groups as separate from each other (in our case the colonists versus the colonised); the problem however occurs when the real-world depiction the historical process of colonisation is so simplified that it may trigger a generalised and simplified view of entire cultures as encountered in the game by the player. As Souvik Mukherjee notes: Portrayal of the colonies is often simplistic and contains inaccuracies that are immediately obvious to players from these regions [�] The stereotypes and simplification are instrumental in reinforcing the player�s reduced Borit et al: Representations of Colonialism in Three Popular Modern Board Games 28 and distorted image about the colonies. The purpose of this strategy is to facilitate the player�s connectedness to the game�s mechanism by immersion into a familiar milieu. (Mukherjee 2016: 7) A summary of colonial representations in the three games included in this study is given in Table 2. When scrutinising the three games included in our study it is interesting to note that the newer the game is the more complex and comprehensive the depiction of colonial reality. For instance in the oldest game Puerto Rico (released in 2002) there are no representations at all of colonised populations and their indigenous culture. This is slightly changed in Struggle of Empires (released in 2004) where colonised populations are present in the game elements and artwork. Out of the three games the newest one Archipelago (released in 2012) gives natives the most important role as the emergent behaviour of these figures has the potential to end the game and result in all the players losing the game. Thus there is a clear progression in realism and in political correctness in the three games analysed: from Puerto Rico through to Struggle of Empires and finally Archipelago. A deeper examination of the factors underpinning this progression would require the analysis of a much larger range of games which is beyond the scope of this study but at least two theories can be put forward here. The first is that older games may be more simplistic and newer games may be more realistic in the portrayal of colonisation. This reading would suggest that Puerto Rico is a fairly straightforward introductory Eurogame in which beginners can quickly learn to play and given this level of accessibility advanced mechanisms for unrest or rebellion level or similar could not be realistically incorporated into the game without sacrificing its appealing simplicity. Although there are many examples of games that do not adhere to this principle as uncovered through discussions with very experienced board gamers1 overall it seems that this theory might have some merit. The second explanation  1 These discussions were collected as part of personal communication during EuropeMasters the open European Championship Boardgames at which Petter Olsen has been a member of the Norwegian team several times. Borit et al: Representations of Colonialism in Three Popular Modern Board Games 29 is related to the increasing complexity of board games which have progressively increased the sophistication of their game mechanics and are therefore not so easy for beginners to grasp. This second reading would be supported by the fact that Table 2: Summary of colonial representations in Puerto Rico Struggle of Empires and Archipelago. Puerto Rico Struggle of Empires Archipelago �Discovered� colony is represented as an antithesis of the metropolis � Empty space (terra nullius) � Need of governance and technology � Need of governance and technology � Need of military training � Antithetic labour division � Scarcely populated � Need of governance and technology � Native culture has opposite effect on indigenous people than the colonist culture The Other � Space � Space � Humans � Space � Humans Subaltern voice � Not represented � Partial � Partial Agency of the colonised � Not represented � False agency � Emergent agency Native cultures � Not represented � Clothing � Occupations � Adornments � Clothing � Occupation � Residences � Ritual body paintings � Sanctuaries � Totems Stereotypes � The colonist � The environment � The colonist � The colonised � The environment � The colonist � The colonised � The environment Eurocentrism Yes Yes Yes Borit et al: Representations of Colonialism in Three Popular Modern Board Games 30 the most recently released game of the three under consideration Archipelago has substantially more complicated game mechanics than the earlier games Puerto Rico and Struggle of Empires. Moulding the Player�s Perception of Colonial Times and Ideology As critics in game studies argue the player is not the controlling subject of the game. Rather the game plays the player (Gadamer 2004). The player becomes an implied player or what Espen Aarseth calls �a role made for the player by the game a set of expectations that the player must fulfil for the game to �exercise its effect�� (Aarseth 2007: 132). This approach leads us to ask: is the player of Puerto Rico Struggle of Empires or Archipelago actually playing the colonist or is the game itself forcing the player inevitably into the stereotyped role of the colonist something that is necessary for the game to unfold in the proper way as pre-determined by its designers? In all the three games the implication of the player is manipulated to adhere to the colonialist�s perspective � the game narrative physical elements and mechanics ineluctably cast the player in a position that allows him/her to vicariously participate in the game�s simulation of colonisation and to imagine being on the side of the typical coloniser. The player is invited to customise and personalise his/her behaviour in such a way as to perpetually adopt the perspective of the European coloniser. The player is therefore offered limited options in developing the diegetic sphere of the game since he/she is confined to the framework delineated by the game�s formal and discursive backdrop. Trapped into playing the stereotyped colonist the player can never experience the world through the eyes of the Other nor as a non-typical colonist. We wonder whether the virtual experience of participating in the colonial history that such games produce could possibly encourage players to exhibit the behaviour and attitude of colonisers; a re-enactment that could potentially migrate into the outside world beyond the diegetic framework of the game and become instrumental in reinforcing the neo-colonial ideology that (still) claims the political economic and cultural supremacy of the West. That said it is interesting to note that a similar critique was levelled against these three games by some players who Borit et al: Representations of Colonialism in Three Popular Modern Board Games 31 as in the case of Archipelago observed �that they do not enjoy reinforcing a power dynamic that still exists and is problematic today� (Nasella 2012). Other players of the same game defend it by describing ways in which players could if they wanted play in a more �anti-colonialist� manner by �keeping a look at the needs of the local population and the rate of unemployment in the colony� (Nasella 2012). At first glance this practice might be seen as the strategy of building counternarratives that players can exhibit through a counterplay action in what Tom Apperley calls the sense of �the player producing results that were otherwise unanticipated during the design process� through forms of play that are �experimental innovative risky unintended and unruly� (Apperley 2010: 132). However as noted by players who are critical of these games this kind of play would only convey the message that �it is OK to colonize a population as long as you consider their needs� (Nasella 2012) and thus it is not really enacting a different kind of historical narrative. Nor does such play produce unanticipated results for that matter as the �good� coloniser game play is built into the game as an option; through for example the secret objective of the separatist when a player wins and all the others lose if a rebellion starts in the archipelago. Thus as is the case with similar games in the digital domain (Hammar 2017) the board games we have considered in this study refuse to offer a counterfactual narrative of colonisation: that is to say players are not able through any gaming strategy to rewrite history from an anti-colonial perspective. In this context and following Warraq�s critique of Said�s theory (Warraq 2007) an interesting question could be to examine whether the depiction in these kinds of strategy-based simulation games of some of the more positive outcomes of Western colonialism in certain regions of the world could make these Eurogames less problematic. If we consider the fact that playing historical games can influence processes of cultural memory related to one�s identity (Hammar 2017) it is crucial to reflect upon what kind of symbolic heritage is embodied in the games Puerto Rico Struggle of Empires and Archipelago; and whether such heritage acts as a trigger for cultural memory initiating meanings associated with what has happened in the past. The cultural aspects of colonial ideology are defined by Said in Orientalism as Borit et al: Representations of Colonialism in Three Popular Modern Board Games 32 establishing �a discourse that through journalism literature academia and politics encouraged legitimized and even enabled or produced the British domination of great portions of the East� (H�glund 2008: n. pag.). Modern board games can be seen as variants of such cultural productions and through the formal and generic characteristics that we have discussed in previous sections Puerto Rico Struggle of Empires and Archipelago contribute to a lesser or greater degree to the perpetuation of stereotypical colonist perspectives. From this point of view these three games seem to reinforce Said�s perspective that Orientalism has always been somehow part of the cognitive mind-set of the West from the ancient Greeks to modern times. We would suggest that the games exhibit a lesser correlation with the perspective of Said�s most prominent critiques notably Ahmad and Al-Azm (Ahmad 1992; Al-Azm 1981) who place Orientalism among the consequences of colonialism and do not see it as an expression of a deeper ontological divide between East and West. The game designers and game producers of the 21st century now have access to a multitude of inspirational sources when creating their gameworlds: not only official recorded history but also non-mainstream historical theories and counterfactual history. Despite the rich resources available to designers in researching their simulated historical worlds games such Puerto Rico Struggle of Empires and Archipelago which perpetuate Eurocentric prejudices and fail to interrogate the European colonial project keep appearing on the market. In this context what remains to be answered is the question of whether and how contemporary board games could become more progressive in their depiction of colonial themes and colonial history and how more progressive games might point towards Ahmad�s and Al-Azm�s perspective as described above. The virtual worlds of these modern board games are powerful because they make it possible to develop what scholars call �situated� understanding (Shaffer Squire Halverson & Gee 2005). A situated understanding of a concept implies the ability to understand the concept in ways that are customisable to different situations of use. Thus this approach stresses the experiential foundation of knowledge acquisition suggesting that learning is tied to activity and experience in the world before it is learned in the form of facts and information (Olson & Torrance 2009: 319). As we Borit et al: Representations of Colonialism in Three Popular Modern Board Games 33 have demonstrated in this article the importance of experiential learning means that the simulated experience of colonial history experienced by players of Puerto Rico Struggle of Empires and Archipelago unfortunately serves to reinforce a colonial perspective: ultimately players learn what it means to behave like a colonist even if a stereotyped one. Conclusion This study contributes to filling in the gap of research that explores how board games touch upon issues that are related directly or indirectly to colonial themes; and the ways in which they construct various conceptions of race identity and society through historical re-enactment and representations. We have focused our analysis on three games that have been rated among the top three-hundred board games in the world: Puerto Rico (2002) Struggle of Empires (2004) and Archipelago (2012). Building on McLeod�s definition of colonialism and interpretation of colonial economies (McLeod 2010) Said�s theory of Orientalism (Said 2003) and Spivak�s theory of subalternity (Spivak 1996) this study has comparatively explored how these three games construct representations of: otherness of colonial subjects in relation with the colonisers; indigenous peoples� agency and subaltern voice; expressions of the indigenous culture; and Eurocentrism. Our analysis suggests that the three games encourage the Eurocentric depiction of colonial subjects. The image of such subjects that players of these games receive is created through Western forms of discourse that focus on biased visual representations which stereotype how native populations look (e.g. the black slaves in Struggle of Empires); and a limited and clich�d representation of their possible sphere of activity or labour (e.g. gathering the harvest reproducing more colonial subjects and rebelling as demonstrated in Archipelago). Thus these three games reveal a selective approach to historical representation in which only some of the historical functions of colonialism and European capitalist production are depicted whilst others such as the cultural enrichment of the colonist at the expense of the colonised subject or ethnic and cultural complexities and diversity are overlooked. Through game mechanics game rules and graphic representations the three games Borit et al: Representations of Colonialism in Three Popular Modern Board Games 34 thus work to humanise the colonist while de-humanising the colonial subject sometimes though the latter�s invisibility or its lack of agency detail and complex characterisation. However even though there are many common themes to be found across these three games there are as demonstrated above particularities that differentiate them and make Archipelago the most accurate representation of colonialism among the three games. There are three main components that categorise board games as such: the artefact the practices associated with the artefact and the values that are intrinsic to both the material and operational dimension. The risk that many players are exposed to when playing the three games analysed in this study implies a value-free perception of the gaming activity. Constructing the graphic execution game mechanics and narrative dynamics primarily to ensure the games are entertaining could possibly distract players� focus from critically assessing the moral aspects that the games imply. As Higgins underlines �game companies must understand the importance of tearing fantasy from its Eurocentric and colonial roots as well as destroying the connotation of humanity with whiteness� (Higgin 2008: 21). Thus as a medium games provide an informal entry point for the idea that the West needs to intervene in the East �which largely go[es] un-noticed and unchallenged� (Chakraborti 2015: 183); consequently this study has attempted to raise awareness about the ways in which Puerto Rico Struggle of Empires and Archipelago (mis)represent images of the realities of colonial history and its vastly exploitative relations. By inviting players to engage in an incomplete re-enactment of a morally questionable past through the eyes of the stereotyped colonist these games might therefore influence the player�s cultural social and aesthetic experience of those ideological and historical phenomena connected to colonialism. As Chapman puts it �games tend to tell us more about the present self than the collective past� (Chapman 2016: 203).

2016 SYED SPRUIT BORIT bootstrapping a semantic lexicon.pdf,Bootstrapping a Semantic Lexicon on Verb Similarities Shaheen Syed1 Marco Spruit1 and Melania Borit2 1Department of Information and Computer Sciences Utrecht University Utrecht The Netherlands 2Norwegian College of Fishery Science University of Troms� Troms� Norway {s.a.s.syed m.r.spruit}@uu.nl melania.borit@uit.no Keywords: Semantic Lexicon Bootstrapping Extraction Patterns Web Mining. Abstract: We present a bootstrapping algorithm to create a semantic lexicon from a list of seed words and a corpus that was mined from the web. We exploit extraction patterns to bootstrap the lexicon and use collocation statistics to dynamically score new lexicon entries. Extraction patterns are subsequently scored by calculating the conditional probability in relation to a non-related text corpus. We find that verbs that are highly domain related achieved the highest accuracy and collocation statistics affect the accuracy positively and negatively during the bootstrapping runs. 1 INTRODUCTION Semantic lexicons for specific domains are increasingly becoming important in many Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks such as information extraction word sense disambiguation anaphora resolution speech recognition and discourse processing. Online lexical resources such as WordNet (Miller et al. 1990) and Cyc (Lenat 1995) are useful for generic domains but often fall short for domains that include specific terms jargon acronyms and other lexical variations. Handcrafting domain-specific lexicons can be time-consuming and costly. Various techniques have been developed to automatically create semantic lexicons such as lexicon induction lexicon learning lexicon bootstrapping lexical acquisition hyponym learning and web-based information extraction. We define a semantic lexicon as a dictionary of hyponym words that share the same hypernym. For example cat dog or cow are all hyponym words that share the hypernym ANIMAL. Likewise the words red green and blue are semantically related by the hypernym COLOR. A semantic lexicon differs from an ontology or taxonomy as it does not describe the formal representation of shared conceptualizations or information about concepts and their instances nor does it provide a strict hierarchy of classes. Several attempts have been made to automatically create semantic lexicons from text corpora by utilizing semantic relations in conjunctions (dogs and cats and cows) lists (dogs cats cows) appositives (labrador retriever a dog) and compound nouns (dairy cow) (Riloff and Shepherd 1997; Roark and Charniak 1998; Phillips and Riloff 2002; Widdows and Dorow 2002). Others have used extraction patterns (Colombia was divided the country was divided) (Thelen and Riloff 2002; Igo and Riloff 2009) instance/concept (�is-a�) relationships (Pantel and Ravichandran 2004) coordination patterns (Ziering et al. 2013a) multilingual symbiosis (Ziering et al. 2013b) or combinations thereof (Qadir and Riloff 2012). Lexical learning from informal text such as social media has also been performed (Qadir et al. 2015). Learning semantic lexicons is often based on existing corpora that may not be available for all domains. Furthermore little research on lexicon learning has been performed on web text from informative sites forums blogs and comment sections that contain content written by a variety of people thus containing different writing idiosyncracies. We incorporate web mining techniques to build our own domain corpus and combine the BASILISK (Thelen and Riloff 2002) bootstrapping algorithm and the Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) scoring metric proposed by (Igo and Riloff 2009). We based the hyponym relationships on the extraction pattern context of verb stem similarities and used a probability scoring metric to extract the most suitable verbs. Our aim is to use existing web content to create a semantic lexicon and subsequently use extraction patterns to find semantically related words. Extraction patterns and more specifically the verbs within these patterns are Syed S. Spruit M. and Borit M. Bootstrapping a Semantic Lexicon on Verb Similarities.

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: First we present previous work in semantic lexicon learning for hypernym-hyponym relationships. Second we detail our bootstrapping algorithm the extraction of the text corpus the creation of extraction patterns and the scoring method. Third we analyze the semantic lexicon and the accuracy of our algorithm during each successive run of the bootstrapping process. We then conclude our work and provide new research directives. 2 PREVIOUS WORK (Riloff and Shepherd 1997) used noun co-occurrence statistics to bootstrap a semantic lexicon from raw data. Their bootstrapping algorithm scored conjunctions lists appositives and nominal compounds to find category words within a context window. It is one of the first attempts to build a semantic lexicon and uses human intervention to review the words and select the best ones for the final dictionary. (Roark and Charniak 1998) applied a similar technique but use a different definition for noun co-occurrence and scoring candidate words. (Riloff and Shepherd 1997) ranked and selected candidate words based on the ratio of noun co-occurrences in the seed list to the total frequency of the noun in the corpus while (Roark and Charniak 1998) used log-likelihood statistics (Dunning 1993) for final ranking. (Widdows and Dorow 2002) used graph models of the British National Corpus for lexical acquisition. They focused on the relationships between nouns when they occurred as part of a list. The nodes represent nouns and are linked to each other when they conjunct with either and or or. The edges are weighted by the frequency of the co-occurrence. Their algorithm mitigates the infection of bad words entering the candidate word list by looking at type frequency rather than token frequency. (Phillips and Riloff 2002) automatically created a semantic lexicon by looking at strong syntactic heuristics. They distinguish between two types of lexicons (1) proper noun phrase and (2) common nouns by utilizing the syntactic relationships between them. Syntactic structures are defined by appositives compound nouns and �is-a� clauses� identity clauses with a main verb of to be. Statistical filtering is applied to avoid inaccurate syntactic structures and deterioration of the lexicon entries. (Pantel and Ravichandran 2004) also looked at �is-a� relationships by looking at concept signatures and applying a top-down approach. Their method first uses cooccurrence statistics for semantic classes to then find the most appropriate hyponym relationship. (Thelen and Riloff 2002) proposed a weakly supervised bootstrapping algorithm (BASILISK) to learn semantic lexicons by looking at extraction patterns. They used the AutoSlog (Riloff 1996) extraction pattern learner and a list of manually selected seed words to build semantic lexicons for the MUC-4 proceedings a terrorism domain related corpus. Extraction patterns capture role relationships and are used to find noun phrases with similar semantic meaning as a result of syntax and lexical semantics. This is explained by their example verb robbed. The subject of the verb robbed often indicates the perpetrator while the direct object of the verb robbed could indicate the victim or target. To avoid inaccurate words entering the lexicon and to increase the overall accuracy they learned multiple categories simultaneously. (Igo and Riloff 2009) used BASILISK and applied co-occurrence statistics for hypernym en seed word collocation by computing a variation of Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI). They used web statistics to re-rank the words after the bootstrapping process was finished. (Qadir and Riloff 2012) used pattern-based dictionary induction contextual semantic tagging and coreference resolution in an ensemble approach. They combined the three techniques in a single bootstrapping process and added lexicon entries if words occur in at least two of the three methods. Since each of them exploit independent sources their ensemble method improves precision in the early stages of the bootstrapping process in which semantic drift (Curran et al. 2007) can decrease the overall accuracy substantially. (Ziering et al. 2013b) have also employed an ensemble method and used linguistic variations between multiple languages to reduce semantic drift. We combine the BASILISK bootstrapping algorithm (Thelen and Riloff 2002) and co-occurrence statistics proposed by (Igo and Riloff 2009) to dynamically score each word before it enters the lexicon. We compare BASILISK�s scoring metric AvgLog in contrast to the PMI metric at each bootstrap run rather than using PMI scores to re-rank the lexicon after the bootstrapping process has finished. 3 LEXICON BOOTSTRAPPING We use a list of seed words to initiate the bootstrapping process and use this set of seed words to create KDIR 2016 - 8th International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Information Retrieval 190 a highly related text corpus by mining the web. Web mining was applied because domain specific corpora are not always readily available. Before bootstrapping begins we use the linguistic expressions of extraction patterns (Riloff 1996) and group noun phrases when they occur with the same stemmed verb. The stemmed verbs are then scored by a probability score with respect to a non-related text corpus. Verbs that are domain specific that is they infrequently occur in general text are given a higher score. We then use BASILISK�s bootstrapping algorithm and a PMI scoring metric before adding new words to the lexicon. The PMI score is a measure of association between words. For this we use web count statistics between hyponym and hypernym words to calculate collocation statistics and utilize these scores to only allow the strongest hyponyms to enter the lexicon thus decreasing wrong lexicon entries during the bootstrapping process. A schematic overview of the bootstrapping process is displayed in Figure 1 and Algorithm 1. We will discuss the bootstrapping process in detail in subsequent sections. seed words corpus create extraction patterns extract semantic lexicon initialize pattern pool select topN patterns word pool extract nouns add topN words Figure 1: Schematic overview of bootstrapping process.

The fisheries domain includes a multitude of knowledge production approaches from mono- to transdisciplinary. Biologists oceanographers mathematicians computer scientists anthropologists sociologists political scientists economists and researchers from many other more disciplines contribute to the fisheries body of knowledge together with non-academic participants such as decision makers and stakeholders. Due to these diverse contributions of specialized language from a multitude of knowledge production approaches the fisheries domain is characterized by a large body of words. For the same reason this body of words is extremely rich in concepts. However sometimes the concepts use different words to refer to the same abstraction (e.g. fishermen and fishers) and sometimes even though they are using the same words they are referring to different abstractions (e.g. fisher behavior may mean something for an economist and something else for an anthropologist). In addition the fisheries domain has a high frequency of compound words (e.g. fisheries management fishing method) in order to differentiate it from other resource management domains such as forestry for example. The definition of a hyponym-hypernym relation is therefore based on a more abstract level and also includes transitive relationships. For example if x is a hyponym of y and y is a hyponym of z then x is a hyponym of z. The seed words were chosen by experts from the Arctic University of Norway where they were asked for a list of 10 nouns or compound nouns that best cover the domain. The list contains the phrases fishery ecosystem fisheries management fisheries policy fishing methods fishing gear fishing area fish fish species fishermen fish supply chain. 3.2 Building the Corpus The fisheries corpus was created by extracting web text from a Google search for each of the seed words and extracting the content of the first 30 URLs. We enclosed the 10 search terms with quotations marks to force Google into an exact match. We found that the first 30 searches provided sufficient text for the corpus and still contained search related content. After mining the pages we started an extensive data cleaning process. Besides cleaning HTML JavaScript and CSS tags we needed to clean text from e.g. headers footers labels sidebars that entered the corpus. We removed content such as �click here� �all rights reserved� �copyright�. Finally we scored the mined text fragments with an en-US and en-GB lookup dictionary D as: Stexti = Vi ? i=1 wi Vi (1) Where Vi is the vocabulary size of texti and wi a word Bootstrapping a Semantic Lexicon on Verb Similarities 191 match such that wi ? D. We found Stexti ? 0.3 sufficient to clean the corpus even further as it removes non-English and improper formatted text. For example phrases like �Not logged inTalkContributionsCreate accountLog in� bear no meaning and serves navigational purposes only when rendered by the web browser yet it is extracted from the HTML content. Figure 2 shows the dispersion plot for the seed words unigrams after the cleaning phase. Figure 2: The lexical dispersion plot shows how often a word displayed on the y-axis occurs in the cleaned corpus. The x-axis displays the position within the corpus from beginning to end. 3.3 Chunking We used the Punkt sentence tokenizer and a part-ofspeech (POS) tagger to create individual sentences with their grammatical properties. We then used a shallow parser with regular expressions (RE) on POS tags to extract noun phrases (NP) when they occur as a direct object or subject. The verb that precedes or follows the NP is used to group related NPs when they share the same stem. The RE grammar for the parser is defined as (1) (<VB.*><DT>?<JJ>*<NN>+) for direct object noun phrases and (2) (<DT>?<JJ>*<NN>+<VB.*>+) as subject noun phrases. (1) extracts a verb in any tense (<VB.*>) followed by an optional determiner (<DT>) followed by 0 or more adjectives (<JJ>*) and ending with at least one noun (<NN>+). Figure 3 shows the parse tree of the phrase manage European fish and protect the marine environment. We extract two patterns manage European fish and protect the marine environment. (2) extracts patterns starting with an optional determiner (<DT>) followed by 0 or more adjectives (<JJ>*) followed by at least one noun (<NN>+) and ending in any verb tense (<VB.*>). Figure 4 shows the parse tree for the phrase the northern fisherman S NP NN environment NN marine DT the VB protect CC and NP NN fish JJ European VB manage Figure 3: Parse tree for the noun phrase European fish with its accompanying transitive verb manage and noun phrase the marine environment with transitive verb protect. Both NPs occur as a direct object. catches in which the NP occurs as a subject. S VB catches NP NN fisherman JJ northern DT the Figure 4: Parse tree for the noun phrase the northern fisherman with its accompanying transitive verb catches. The NP occurs as a subject. 3.4 Scoring Verbs The verb tenses that precede an NP as a direct object or follow the NP as a subject are stemmed with the Porter algorithm (Porter 1980) to subsequently group NPs when creating the extraction patterns. Stemming groups verb tenses into the same stem�not necessarily the root of the verb. To score stemmed verbs we used a non-related text corpus containing rural information. The idea behind scoring the domain related verbs is to limit the extraction patterns to verbs that are more frequently found in the fisheries domain. For example the verb create is often found in all sorts of domains but the verb catch not. The noun phrases that are linked to the verb catch are more likely to contain semantically related words. Let D1 be the set of stemmed verbs from the seed word related corpus (Section 3.2) and D2 be the set of stemmed verbs from the non-related corpus (rural corpus) and that the vocabulary size |V |D1 ? |V |D2 . Now let L be the combined set of stemmed verbs such that for every l ? L we have that l ? D1 ?D2. Let NlD1 denote the number of instances l contain in D1. We estimate the probability that stemmed verb l contained within the seed word related set D1: P(l|D1) = NlD1 NlD1 +NlD2 (2) KDIR 2016 - 8th International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Information Retrieval 192 For example the verb supervise which includes supervised and supervising gets stemmed into supervis. A frequency of D1=12 and D2=3 results in a score of 0.8. The distribution of scores is shown in Figure 5 and shows the number of verbs with their estimated probability. For example there are 50 verbs with a score ?? 0.9 which are highly domain related such as prohibit catch rescue exploit breath deplete fish. 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 Score 0 50 100 150 200 250 Fr e q u e n cy  N 1  +  N 2 Figure 5: Frequency of stemmed verbs and estimated probability. 3.5 Verb Extraction Pattern We selected verbs in which ?? 0.5 and group them in steps of 0.1 such that 0.9? ?? 1.0 0.8? ?? 1.0 ...  0.5? ?? 1.0 so that we analyze the top 10% 20% ...  50% of verbs. To create the extraction pattern any noun <NN> or compound noun <NN>+ extracted by the chunker is grouped together if they share the same stemmed verb in either subject and direct object cases. For example Table 1 shows some phrases for the root verb regulate which gets stemmed into regul and root verb catch which has an identical stem. The nouns industry seafood trade quota and legislation are grouped together into an extraction pattern because they all share the same stem regulate. For every NP we have extracted the noun or compound noun. We have not restricted ourselves to the head noun as compound nouns are generally more informative for the fisheries domain. For example marine science was accepted as a fisheries related word but science not. An overview of some extraction patterns are listed below: � {industry seafood trade quota legislation} � {fish marine life deep-dwelling fish fisherman} � {catch conservation sustainability growth fishing participation tuna management approach} � {oxygen air fish equipment right} � {sediment resuspension world bycatch potential fishing technique hunger} Table 1: Example phrases where the transitive verb of a phrase gets stemmed into the same stem. stem verb noun phrase regul regulated industry ... regulated industry ... regul regulated seafood trade ... regulated seafood trade ... regul regulated quota ... quota regulated ... regul regulates legislation ... legislation regulates ... catch catching fish ... catching wild fish ... catch catching marine life ... catching marine life ... catch catch deep-dwelling fish ... catch deep-dwelling fish ... catch catches fisherman ... the fisherman catches ... We found 468 different extraction patterns in our corpus. An overview of the distribution is shown in Figure 6 (y-axis logarithmically scaled). 0 100 200 300 400 500 pattern(i) 101 102 103 n o u n  f re q u e n cy Figure 6: The frequency of nouns in an extraction pattern. The x-axis shows the number of extraction patterns found in our corpus (468). The y-axis shows the number of nouns grouped within that pattern. 3.6 Bootstrapping The bootstrapping process starts with a list of 10 seed words (Section 3.1). Next all the extraction patterns are scored by calculating the RlogF score (Riloff 1996): RlogF(patterni) = { Fi Ni ? log2(Fi) if Fi ? 1 ?1 if Fi = 0 (3) Where Fi is the number of lexicon words found in patterni and Ni the total number of nouns in patterni. Extraction patterns that contain nouns that are already part of the lexicon will get a higher score. The first iteration selects the top N patterns which are then placed into a pattern pool. We used N=20 for the first iteration and incremented it by 1 every next run to allow new patterns to enter the process. The next step is to score all the nouns that are part of the pattern pool. We evaluated two scoring Bootstrapping a Semantic Lexicon on Verb Similarities 193 metrics: (1) BASILISK�s AvgLog (2) PMI that uses search counts from the Bing search engine. The AvgLog score is defined as: AvgLog(wordi) = Pi ? j=1 log2(Fj +1) Pi (4) (1) AvgLog uses all the patterns to score the nouns found in the top N patterns. Pi is the number of patterns in which wordi occurs and Fj the number of lexicon words found in pattern j. The nouns that are part of the pattern pool are given a higher score thus being more semantically related when they also occur in other extraction patterns with a high number of lexicon word matches. (2) is based on hypernym collocation statistics proposed by (Igo and Riloff 2009). We implement the PMI scoring metric within the bootstrapping process and dynamically calculate collocation statistics before adding new words in the lexicon. We hypothesize that lexicon words that occur more often in collocation with its domain are more likely to be semantically related. We use the number of hits between a lexicon word (hyponym) and its hypernym word by utilizing the NEAR operator from the Microsoft�s BING search engine. We choose collocation range of 10 and define the PMI score as: PMIxy = log ?xy ?x?y (5) PMIxy = log(N)+ log Nxy NxNy (6) PMIxy = log Nxy NxNy (7) PMIxy is the Pointwise Mutual Information that lexicon word x occurs with hypernym y where ?xy is the probability that x and y occur together on the web ?x the probability that x occurs on the web and ?y the probability that y occurs on the web. We would have to calculate probabilities such as ?x by dividing the number of x by the total number of web pages N and can rewrite PMIxy by incorporating N. However N is not known and can be omitted because it will be the same for each lexicon word. We can rewrite PMIxy again by taking the log of the number of hits from the collocation statistics and dividing it by statistics of their individual parts. Each noun that was part of the extraction pattern was given a score and the top-N nouns were selected to enter the lexicon. We added the noun with the highest score (N=1) to the lexicon and repeated the bootstrapping process. 4 EVALUATION We evaluated the lexicon entries by a gold standard dictionary. Domain experts have labeled every noun or compound noun that was found in the extraction patterns. A value of 1 was assigned if the word was related to the fisheries domain and 0 if it had no relationship. We did not distinguish between highly relevant domain words and less relevant words. For example the word marine science is highly relevant and has often a direct link to the domain but the word conservation in itself can be ambiguous. It could be related to e.g. conserving artwork or to prevent depletion of natural resources. However a word was considered to be correct if any sense of the word is semantically related. Furthermore unknown words were manually looked up for their meaning. For example plecoglossus altivelis oncorhynchus keta leucosternon peach anthias and khaki grunter are types of fish unknown to the annotators yet are semantically related. We have run the bootstrapping algorithm until the lexicon contained 100 words. We repeated the process for the top 10% to top 50% scored verbs as discussed in Section 3.5 and compared the AvgLog (Sb) and PMI (Spmi) scoring metric. Examples of lexicon entries are: invertebrate seafood ground fish shellfish demersal fish mackerel carp crabs deepwater shrimp school life squid hake fisherman cod tuna conservation reference size trout quota sea shrimp mortality freshwater trawl salmon tenkara snapper method license attractor pocket water fee vessel license style fly artisan plastic worm freshwater fly saltwater jack mackerel trawler. Figure 7 shows the accuracy (percentage of correct lexicon words) for Sb when learning 100 semantically related words. The lines represent the verb probability groupings (e.g. top 10% 20%). The accuracy degrades when incorrect words enter the lexicon and starts to contribute in learning more incorrect words. The accuracy converges to around 70% for all probability groupings. Figure 8 shows the accuracy for Spmi. It shows that using web statistics for hyponymhypernym words affects the accuracy positively and negatively yet still converges to around 70% after 100 words are learned. The use of Spmi affects the top 30% verbs substantially outperforming Sb up to learning 90 words. However Spmi negatively affects the accuracy when looking at the top 50% verbs compared to Sb. Scoring verbs before creating extraction patterns causes differences in accuracy up to a lexicon size of 90.

We would however have expected that the top 10% verbs outperform the top 20% and so on. This does not seem to hold for both Sb and Spmi. For example when using Sb and learning 50 words the top 50% verbs achieved a higher accuracy (0.74) compared to the top 20% (0.66). Similarly when learning 40 words and using Spmi the top 20% verbs achieved lower accuracy (0.68) than the top 30% verbs (0.78). The top 10% verbs for Sb and Spmi achieve the highest accuracy in nearly all stages of the bootstrapping process. Small lexicons would benefit from selecting only the top 10% verbs to create extraction patterns achieving an accuracy of around 0.8 when learning 50 words. An overview of all accuracy scores is given in Table 2. 5 CONCLUSION In this paper we presented a bootstrapping algorithm based on BASILISK and a highly related corpus that was created by mining web pages. We have created the corpus by utilizing the same set of seed words that initially was used to start the bootstrapping process. We used extraction patterns to group noun phrases with similar semantic meaning by grouping them when they share the same stemmed verb. We scored the extraction patterns with a non-related text corpus and calculated accuracy scores for the top 10% 20% 30% 40% and 50%. Next to using BASILISK original scoring metric we used a PMI score by looking at hyponym-hypernym collocation statistics. We found varied results between the scored extraction patterns. Patterns that were created by looking at strong verbs that most often occur in domain related text and less frequent in general (non-related) text created a higher accuracy lexicon when looking at the top 10% scored verbs while other top scores showed mixed results. The use of collocation statistics by utilizing the NEAR operator of Microsoft�s Bing search engine provided better accuracy for a number of scores but simultaneously caused a degrade in the accuracy for other verb scores. The achieved accuracy covers web text for the Bootstrapping a Semantic Lexicon on Verb Similarities 195 fisheries domain and more research is needed concerning the generalizability into other domains and other forms of text such as scientific literature and other technical language. Furtermore research is needed to explain why accuracy varies between verb scores and why collocation statistics work better in some cases. Finally research is also necessary when scoring the verbs against a non-related text corpus to see which types or genres of non-related domain corpora affects the domain under study.

2019 WEINES BORIT playing with the past.pdf,PLAYING WITH THE PAST TO UNDERSTAND THE PRESENT: THE POTENTIAL OF USING NUSFJORD (2017) TO TEACH ABOUT THE COMPLEXITY OF FISHERIES AS SOCIO-ECOLOGICAL SYSTEMS The potential of using Nusfjord (2017) to Teach About the Complexity of Fisheries as Socio-Ecological Systems J�RN WEINES AND MELANIA BORIT Extended Abstract Games are vehicles that transport their players between different realties (Peters & Westelaken 2014). By doing this they have the potential to provide many different benefits for their players such as relaxation excitement social interaction and learning. Higher education is increasingly trying to capitalize on this potential and many teachers now make use of different forms of game-based learning and serious games (Plass et al. 2015). Some educators design their own games (Weines et al. 2017) while others either use existing serious games (Qudrat-Ullah et al. 1997) or try to repurpose commercial off-the-shelf video games (Whitton 2010) or board games (Bridge 2014). Following suite at our own department we count on the assumption of enhanced learning through games and we are currently exploring the potential of repurposing various entertainment board games (e.g. Nusfjord Dominant Species Evolution) in the context of interdisciplinary bachelor�s and master�s programs in fisheries and aquaculture science. These programs combine biology economics and social sciences with a taste of history and technology. Building on previous research suggesting that the use of games in teaching students deeper knowledge about complex concepts such as sustainability is promising (Blanchard & Buchs 2015) in this study we analyze the potential of the game Nusfjord by Uwe Rosenberg (Rosenberg 2017) to be used as an additional learning tool for teaching about fisheries as socio-ecological systems. When teaching about such systems the complexity of achieving economic environmental and social sustainability is an important part of the current discourse (Charles 2001). It is considered that when trying to make sense of this complexity critical thinking problem solving and key interdisciplinary themes that connect these such as global awareness and different literacies play a crucial role. As such these skills are recognized as extremely relevant for the 21st Century learner (Binkley et al 2012). Recent reviews indicate that games are useful in teaching these skills especially when making use of designactivities as part of the teaching (Qian and Clark 2016). Thus we intend to pilot the use of Nusfjord with fisheries management students in late 2018/early 2019. This pilot activity will inform our design of possible game customizations and pre/post game activities that are needed in order for the game to contribute to increased achievement of intended learning outcomes. Nusfjord is a competitive strategy type of Eurogame with an economic development theme where MEANINGFUL PLAY PROCEEDINGS 2018 233 the players are cast as the owners of a major fishing company in Nusfjord in the Lofoten archipelago in Norway. The goal of the players is to develop and expand the harbor and the surrounding area. Exploiting natural resources and using basic market mechanisms in addition to considering the advice from the local community (i.e. �the elders�) are the main tools of each player. On BoardGameGeek.com where users have ranked more than 87000 board games and extensions this game is in top 400 strategy games with more than 1600 votes (date of visit: 16.10.2018). To our knowledge Nusfjord is one of the very few board games with commercial fisheries as the main topic something that makes it an excellent candidate for our endeavors of using entertainment games in fisheries education. Nusfjord invokes the traditional fisheries in the Lofoten Archipelago which is an important part of Norwegian coastal and fisheries history. This is the annual fishery on spawning cod that takes place in the late winter-early spring (February-April). Dating back as far as recorded history goes this fishery attracted fishers from the entire country and was an important part of both subsistence and commercial fisheries. This has resulted in the Lofoten fishery becoming symbolic of coastal culture in Norway. While the scope of the fishery has decreased over the past decades this activity is still an important part of the regional economy and food culture. Furthermore Lofoten�s importance both as a spawning ground and basis for small-scale fishers makes it topical in ongoing discussions about tourism development (Henley 2016) and potential petroleum exploration in the area (Pedersen 2013 Kolle et al. 2017). In this study we build on the growing body of previous research on historical games (e.g. (Chapman et al. 2017; Borit et al. 2018)) on using games to teach history (e.g. (McCall 2011 2016; Hoy 2018)) as well as how games construct understanding on our own past (Begy 2017). As such we analyze the denotative and connotative meanings of game rules game mechanics artwork and game components of Nusfjord in an attempt to assess their potential for transporting our students between the past reality of the Lofoten fisheries and the current reality of discussions about overexploited fisheries and sustainable marine and coastal management. We investigate how the game presents the history social structures (including ethnic dimensions and gender) modernity and ecology of the Lofoten fisheries and relate it to the current understanding of fisheries as socio-ecological systems. We answer questions such as: How does the game engage with historical realities? Is the reality to which players of Nusfjord are transported a reality that is representative of the one documented in historical works or the present? Are the biological social and economic models present in the game suitable for use in the training of future fisheries/aquaculture industry professionals and managers about the complexity of sustainable fisheries? What are the game elements that are suitable for learning in our fisheries and aquaculture context and what post-game activities are needed for adapting the game for use in game-based learning? This interdisciplinary study lies at the intersection of learning in higher education (historical) game studies and natural resource management research and contributes to the ongoing discussion on meaningful play in the 21st Century higher education.

Fish and Fisheries	Published	by	John	Wiley	&	Sons	Ltd 1? |?INTRODUC TION Following	a	similar	trend	to	scientific	research	at	large	fisheries	science	 research	 output	 has	 significantly	 increased	 in	 the	 last	 three	 decades	 (Aksnes	 &	 Browman	 2016)	 in	 parallel	 with	 an	 increase	 in	 the	 number	 of	 fisheries	 scientific	 journals	 (Mather	 Parrish	 &	 Dettmers	2008).	This	rapid	expansion	of	the	field	 is	attributed	to	 the	growing	concern	about	the	state	of	global	fish	stocks	and	to	the	 major	 role	 that	 science	has	been	playing	 in	 fisheries	management	 (Jari?	Cvijanovi?	Kne�evi?-	Jari?	&	Lenhardt	2012).	However	despite	the	increased	volume	of	fisheries	science	output	and	publication	outlets	the	global	crisis	in	marine	capture	fisheries	management	 is	as	present	as	ever	with	unforeseen	consequences	ranging	from	 fisheries-	induced	evolutionary	changes	among	wild	fish	populations	 (Belgrano	&	Fowler	2013)	to	conflicts	between	states	over	the	implementation	of	best	available	science	 (Brooks	et	al.	2016).	There	 are	 various	 hypotheses	 regarding	 causes	 and	 contributing	 factors	 for	 failures	 of	 fisheries	 management	 including	 data	 uncertainty	 model	inadequacy	ecosystem	structure	institutional	efficacy	economic	discord	or	research	focus	(Smith	&	Link	2005).	Among	these	 research	 focus	 is	 the	 least	 explored	 (Smith	 &	 Link	 2005).	 Using	 hybrid	 content	 analysis	 of	 a	 unique	 dataset	 consisting	 of	 46582	 fisheries	science	full-	text	articles	published	in	the	last	26	years	we	 uncover	focus	topics	in	fisheries	research	and	their	trends. 2? |? ?? SYED Et al. Fisheries	 are	 a	 socio-	ecological	 complex	 adaptive	 system	 (SECAS)	 in	which	macroscopic	properties	 emerge	 from	 local	 actions	that	spread	to	higher	scales	due	to	agents�	(fish	and	humans)	 collective	behaviour;	these	properties	then	feed	back	in	a	nonlinear	way	influencing	individuals�	options	and	behaviours	but	they	 typically	only	do	so	diffusely	and	over	long	timescales	(Levin	et	al.	 2013;	Ostrom	2009).	A	 fishery	 can	be	defined	as	 �the	 complex	 of	people	their	institutions	their	harvest	and	their	observations	 associated	with	and	including	a	targeted	stock	or	group	of	stocks	 (i.e.	usually	fish)	and	increasingly	the	associated	ecosystems	that	 produce	 said	 stocks�	 (Link	 2010).	 Deconstructing	 the	 concept	 the two main dimensions of a fishery are the human dimension (i.e.	 human	 agents	 communities	 of	 these	 and	 their	 institutions)	 and	 the	 natural	 dimension	 (i.e.	 biotic	 such	 as	 predator	 species	 and	 prey	 species	 and	 abiotic	 such	 as	 water	 temperature	 and	 nutrients)	 (Charles	 2001;	 Lennox	 et	al.	 2017;	 �sterblom	 et	al.	 2013).	The	purpose	of	this	study	was	to	assess	whether	fisheries	 science	output	 is	reflecting	this	conceptual	diversity	of	fisheries	 as	SECAS	and	 if	so	 to	what	extent.	 Is	science	diversifying	fisheries	research	topics	 in	an	attempt	to	capture	the	complexity	of	 the	fisheries	system	or	is	it	multiplying	research	on	similar	topics	 trying	to	achieve	an	in-	depth	but	possibly	marginal	understanding	of	 a	 few	selected	components	of	 this	 system?	Based	on	 the	 critical	reflection	that	�the	majority	of	fisheries	scientists	have	a	 biologically	oriented	background	they	can	be	a	bit	na�ve	regarding	other	factors	when	it	comes	to	the	prominence	of	economic	or	 social	considerations�	(Link	2010)	the	working	hypothesis	of	this	 study	 is	 that	 the	 human	dimension	 of	 fisheries	might	 be	 under-	 represented	in	the	fisheries	specialty	literature. The	assessments	of	the	development	and	trends	in	fisheries	science	have	so	far	been	mostly	based	on	reviews	(e.g.	Johnson	et	al.	 2013)	 or	 bibliometric	 evaluations	 (e.g.	 Aksnes	 &	 Browman	 2016)	 of	 scientific	 publications	 in	 the	 field.	 Limitations	 of	 these	 studies	 include	 the	 following:	 taking	 into	 account	 only	 a	 limited	 number	of	publications	 (e.g.	 Jari?	et	al.	2012)	or	a	 limited	time	period	 (e.g.	2000�09;	 Jari?	 et	al.	 2012);	 having	a	 limited	 scope	 [e.g.	 artisanal	coral	reef	fisheries	research	(Johnson	et	al.	2013);	fish	stock	 assessment	 research	 (Kumaresan	 Ezhilrani	 Vinitha	 Sivaraman	 &	 Jayaraman	2014);	shark	by-	catch	research	(Molina	&	Cooke	2012)];	 using	proxies	for	full-	text	articles	[e.g.	titles	(Jari?	et	al.	2012);	abstracts	(Aksnes	&	Browman	2016)]	or	proxies	for	topics	of	research	 [e.g.	 one	 word	 per	 topic	 (Aksnes	 &	 Browman	 2016;	 Jari?	 et	al.	 2012)].	Most	 importantly	 all	 these	 previous	 attempts	 to	map	 the	 fisheries	science	field	are	top-	down	approaches	with	topics	of	interest	manually	predefined	by	the	analysts	[e.g.	species	region	habitat	 study	object	(Jari?	et	al.	2012)]	and	the	analysed	data	manually	assigned	to	these	topics.	However	such	approaches	are	limited	due	to	 the subjectivity inherent in human decisions and the analysis of the same	research	field	could	yield	opposite	results	(e.g.	Rose	Janiger	 Parsons	and	Stachowitsch	(2011)	vs.	Hill	and	Lackups	(2010)	evaluation	of	the	field	of	cetacean	research). In	contrast	to	previous	approaches	we	follow	a	completely	novel	 strategy	 for	 the	 field	 of	 fisheries	 science	 a	 bottom-	up	 approach	 (Debortoli	M�ller	 Junglas	&	vom	Brocke	2016)	by	utilizing	 topic	 modelling	to	uncover	hidden	research	topics	within	fisheries	science	 publications.	Topic	modelling	algorithms	are	machine-	learning	methods to automatically uncover hidden or latent thematic structures from	large	collections	of	documents.	Topic	models	can	produce	a	set	 of	interpretable	topics	that	can	be	viewed	as	groups	of	co-	occurring	 words	 that	are	associated	with	a	single	 topic	or	 theme	 (DiMaggio	 Nag	&	Blei	2013).	Such	groups	of	co-	occurring	words	 (i.e.	 topics)	 are	words	that	tend	to	come	up	together	within	the	same	linguistic	 context	more	 frequently	 than	one	would	expect	by	 chance	alone.	 These	co-	occurring	words	tend	to	purport	similar	meaning	and	refer	 to	a	similar	subject.	For	example	in	the	context	of	fisheries	science	 an	 author	might	write	 a	 text	 to	which	 she/he	 gave	 the	 keywords	 �community	 structure�	 �subtropical	 areas�	 �reference	 points�	 and	 �weight.�	This	 text	might	use	more	frequently	 the	words	�parameters�	 �estimation�	 �stock�	 �modeling�	 �male�	 �female�	 �sex�	 and	 �spawning.�	If	we	wanted	to	use	topic	modelling	to	uncover	the	latent	 topics	of	this	hypothetical	text	based	on	how	often	these	most	used	 words	would	 appear	 together	 (i.e.	 co-	occur)	 the	 automated	 topic	 model	would	group	the	first	four	words	in	one	topic	and	the	last	four	 words	in	a	different	topic.	These	two	topics	would	then	be	manually	 labelled	by	a	domain	expert	most	likely	as	Stock	assessment	modeling	and	Reproduction	respectively.	Note	that	the	subject	of	these	 two	topics	is	not	similar	to	the	one	that	might	be	inferred	from	the	 1	INTRODUCTION 1 2	METHODS 3 2.1	Latent	Dirichlet	allocation 3 2.2	Assumptions	behind	LDA 4 2.3	Creating	the	data	set 4 2.4	Creating	the	LDA	model 7 2.5	Calculating	model	quality 7 2.6	Labelling	topics 7 2.7	Calculating	topical	trends	over	time 8 2.8	Calculating	topic	over	journals 8 2.9	Relaxing	LDA	assumptions	and	future	 research directions 8 3	RESULTS	AND	DISCUSSION 8 3.1	Uncovering	fisheries	topics 8 3.2	Topic	proportions	within	documents 13 3.3	Topical	trends	over	time	and	topic	prevalence 14 3.4	Topical	trends	over	journals 16 3.5	Validation	of	results 16 4	CONCLUSION	AND	RECOMMENDATIONS 17 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS 17 ORCID 17 REFERENCES 18 SUPPORTING	INFORMATION 20 ?? ? | ?3SYED Et al. keywords	given	to	this	hypothetical	text.	Thus	these	topics	are	latent	and	 they	are	hidden	 in	 the	pattern	of	co-	occurring	words.	 In	 essence	 topic	models	are	able	to	exploit	 the	co-	occurrence	structure	of	texts	and	produce	the	topics	as	lists	of	words	that	frequently	 come	up	together	within	and	between	documents;	technically	such	 lists	of	words	are	probability	distributions	over	words. The	topics	emerge	from	the	statistical	properties	of	the	documents and thus overcome the need for manual annotation of the collection	of	texts	although	manual	 interpretation	of	the	subject of	 a	 topic	might	 still	 be	 needed	 as	 it	 is	 yet	 considered	 the	 gold	 standard	in	the	domain	of	topic	modelling	(Lau	Grieser	Newman	 &	Baldwin	2011).	As	such	we	allow	the	documents	to	speak	for	 themselves	 and	 view	 the	 documents	 through	 the	 computational	 lens	of	the	topic	model	rather	than	relying	on	the	manifest	or	reported	 content	 by	 their	 authors.	 Document	 collections	 that	 are	 too	large	to	explore	manually	can	now	be	analysed	to	study	phenomena	of	 the	sort	 that	can	only	be	viewed	through	the	macroscopic	computational	lens	of	the	topic	model	(Mohr	&	Bogdanov	 2013).	Topic	modelling	approaches	have	been	helpful	in	elucidating	the	key	ideas	within	a	set	of	documents	such	as	articles	published in the journal PNAS	 (Griffiths	&	 Steyvers	 2004)	 political	 science	texts	(Grimmer	&	Stewart	2013)	or	data-	driven	journalism	 (Rusch	 Hofmarcher	 Hatzinger	 &	Hornik	 2013).	Moreover	 it	 is	 considered	that	this	approach	could	provide	insight	into	the	development	of	a	scientific	field	and	changes	in	research	priorities	(Neff	 &	Corley	2009)	and	could	do	so	with	greater	speed	and	quantitative	 rigour	 than	would	otherwise	be	possible	 through	 traditional	 narrative	reviews	(Grimmer	&	Stewart	2013).	As	such	this	topic	 modelling	method	has	 been	 applied	 for	 example	 in	 the	 domain	 of	 transportation	 research	 (Sun	 &	 Yin	 2017)	 computer	 science	 (Hall	Jurafsky	&	Manning	2008;	Wang	&	McCallum	2006;	Wang	 Paisley	&	Blei	2011)	 fisheries	modelling	 (Syed	&	Weber	2018)	 conservation	science	(Westgate	Barton	Pierson	&	Lindenmayer	 2015)	and	the	fields	of	operations	research	and	management	science	(Gatti	Brooks	&	Nurre	2015). After	 identifying	 the	 hidden	 topics	 of	 fisheries	 science	 we	 analyse	the	extent	to	which	these	topics	cover	the	complexity	of	 the	fisheries	domain.	Afterwards	we	examine	topic	similarity	topic	 co-	occurrence	 topic	 prevalence	 and	 topical	 trends	 over	 the	 last	 26	years.	We	furthermore	 identify	patterns	 in	 increasing	and	decreasing	topic	trends	over	specific	periods	of	time	(i.e.	hot	and	cold	 topics	in	1990�95	1995�2000	2000�05	2005�10	and	2010�16)	 and	describe	the	distribution	of	uncovered	topics	over	journals. 2? |?METHODS 2.1?|?Latent Dirichlet allocation This	paper	utilizes	the	topic	model	latent	Dirichlet	allocation	(LDA)	 (Blei	2012;	Blei	Ng	&	Jordan	2003).	LDA	is	a	Bayesian	probabilistic	topic	model	and	follows	the	assumption	that	documents	exhibit	 multiple	topics	in	mixing	proportions	thus	capturing	the	heterogeneity	of	for	example	research	topics	within	scientific	publications.	 In	statistics	this	is	often	referred	to	as	a	mixed-	membership	model	 (Erosheva	 Fienberg	 &	 Lafferty	 2004).	 Technically	 a	 topic	 is	 a	 multinomial distribution of words in the vocabulary where each word	has	a	different	probability	within	each	topic;	within	a	topic	 more	 prominent	 words	 have	 a	 higher	 probability	 and	 groups	 of	 high	probability	words	can	be	considered	as	co-	occurring	clusters	 or	constellation	of	words	that	describe	a	certain	underlying	topic	 or	 theme.	 A	 document	 might	 be	 60%	 about	 the	 topic	 Fisheries	 management	and	40%	about	the	topic	Stock	assessment.	A	topic	 �about�	a	 subject	 (e.g.	 fisheries management)	 relates	 to	 the	probability	distribution	of	words	that	places	high	probability	to	words	 that	would	be	used	to	describe	the	subject	(DiMaggio	et	al.	2013).	 Note	that	the	underlying	topics	and	to	what	extent	the	document	 exhibits	these	topics	are	not	known	in	advance.	These	details	are	 the	output	of	the	LDA	analysis	and	emerge	automatically	from	the	 statistical	properties	of	 the	documents	and	 the	assumptions	behind	LDA. One	way	to	think	about	LDA	is	to	imagine	a	document	in	which	 one	highlights	words	with	 coloured	markers.	Words	 that	 relate	 to	 one	topic	are	coloured	blue	words	that	relate	to	another	topic	are	 coloured	red	and	so	on.	After	all	of	the	words	have	been	coloured	 (excluding	words	such	as	�the�	�a�)	all	the	words	with	the	same	colour	are	the	topics	and	the	article	will	blend	the	colours	in	different	 proportions.	Different	documents	will	have	different	blends	of	colours	and	we	could	use	the	proportion	of	the	various	colours	to	situate	this	specific	document	in	a	document	collection	(e.g.	documents	 addressing	mainly	 the	 blue	 topic).	Moreover	 documents	with	 the	 same	blend	of	colours	discuss	the	topics	in	similar	proportion	and	are	 considered	 closely	 related	 from	 a	 topical	 perspective.	 Technically	 documents	 with	 similar	 topic	 distributions	 are	 close	 in	 Kullback� Leibler	divergence	a	measure	to	calculate	the	distance	between	two	 probability	distributions.	LDA	as	a	statistical	model	captures	this	intuition.	We	refer	the	interested	reader	to	Blei	 (2012)	for	a	concise	 introduction	to	LDA. Latent	Dirichlet	 allocation	 is	 best	 described	by	 its	 generative	 process	 that	 is	 the	 imaginary	 probabilistic	 recipe	 that	 generates	 the documents as well as the hidden structure. The hidden structure	is	the	topics	modelled	as	distributions	of	words	and	the	topic	 proportions	per	document	where	each	document	has	some	probability	 for	 each	 latent	 topic	 (i.e.	 mixing	 topic	 proportions).	More	 formally	the	generative	process	also	assigns	each	word	to	a	topic	 as	to	allow	for	documents	to	exhibit	multiple	topics	analogous	to	 the	coloured	words	example.	More	information	on	the	generative	 process	can	be	found	in	the	supplementary	material.	Given	the	observed documents the aim now is to infer the hidden structure to	answer	the	question	�what	is	the	likely	hidden	topical	structure	 that	has	generated	these	documents?�	a	process	that	can	be	seen	 as	 reverse-	engineering	 the	 generative	 process.	 Technically	 we	 want	to	infer	the	posterior	distribution	of	the	latent	variables	given	 the	observed	documents.	An	analogy	to	this	process	 is	described	 by	 the	 local	 farmers�	 market	 example;	 one	 might	 estimate	 what	 vegetables	 and	what	 quantities	 are	 being	 sold	 at	 the	 local	 farmers�	 market	 by	 post	 hoc	 inspection	 of	 people�s	 shopping	 basket.	 4? |? ?? SYED Et al. Seeing	more	 baskets	 refines	 the	 estimation	 of	 the	 products	 and	 their	quantities	and	provides	an	estimate	of	the	market�s	produce	 (Rhody	 2012).	Mainly	 two	 types	 of	 inference	 techniques	 can	 be	 discerned:	 sampling-	based	 algorithms	 (e.g.	 Newman	 Asuncion	 Smyth	 &	 Welling	 2007;	 Porteous	 et	al.	 2008)	 and	 variational-	 based	algorithms	(e.g.	Blei	&	Jordan	2006;	Teh	Newman	Welling	 &	Neaman	2006;	Wang	et	al.	 2011).	 To	 simplify	 posterior	 inference	 LDA	 uses	 a	 Dirichlet	 distribution	 as	 a	 conjugate	 prior	 for	 the	multinomial	distribution	hence	 the	name	LDA.	The	posterior	 distribution	will	 reveal	 the	 probability	 distributions	 of	words	 for	 each	topic	and	the	topic	proportions	per	document.	Note	that	the	 obtained	structure	 is	 latent	 and	 therefore	 the	probability	distributions of words are not semantically labelled. However when sorted	the	words	with	the	highest	probability	within	a	topic	will	relate	to	what	one	would	call	a	topic	or	theme	(DiMaggio	et	al.	2013;	 Mohr	&	Bogdanov	2013).	In	this	context	it	is	important	to	mention	 that	the	LDA	model	does	not	give	a	name	to	each	identified	latent	 topic	 (i.e.	the	model	does	not	 label	the	topics).	The	output	of	the	 model	groups	the	co-	occurring	words	under	numbered	topics	(i.e.	 topic	 1	 topic	 2	 topic	 3).	Albeit	 a	 subjective	 endeavour	 possibly	 affecting	the	statistical	objectiveness	of	the	LDA	method	in	order	 to	 increase	 the	 readability	 and	 interpretability	 of	 these	 topics	 a	 human	analyst	can	be	used	to	interpret	what	is	the	common	subject	of	the	words	within	each	topic	and	consequently	give	a	name	 (i.e.	a	post	hoc	label)	to	this	topic	(DiMaggio	et	al.	2013).	Research	 into	automatic	assignment	of	topic	labels	exists;	however	manual	 annotation	by	a	human	expert	is	still	considered	the	gold	standard	 in	labelling	topics	(Lau	et	al.	2011).	For	our	study	instead	of	using	 the	topic	numbering	provided	by	the	LDA	model	(i.e.	topic	1	topic	 2	 topic	 3)	 in	 order	 to	 increase	 readability	 of	 the	 text	 and	 interpretability	of	results	we	chose	to	give	a	specific	label	to	each	topic	 using	the	gold	standard	 in	this	domain	that	 is	manual	annotation	 (see	the	section	Labelling	topics). 2.2?|?Assumptions behind LDA Latent	Dirichlet	allocation	is	a	bag-	of-	words	model	in	which	documents	are	represented	as	unordered	sequences	of	words.	Such	an	 assumption	neglects	word	order	and	possibly	 important	cues	to	 the	content	of	a	document	(Steyvers	&	Griffiths	2007).	Although	 an	 unrealistic	 assumption	 it	 is	 reasonable	when	uncovering	 semantic	 structures	 of	 text	 (Blei	 2012;	 Blei	 &	 Lafferty	 2006).	 Consider	a	thought	experiment	where	the	words	of	a	document	 are	shuffled.	After	finding	a	high	number	of	words	like	spawning eggs and growth	one	can	 imagine	 that	 the	document	deals	with	 some	 aspects	 of	 reproduction.	 LDA	 further	 assumes	 document	 exchangeability	 that	 is	 the	 order	 in	which	 documents	 are	 analysed	is	unimportant	yet	all	documents	are	analysed	at	the	end	of	 the	LDA	analysis.	Consequently	LDA	is	unable	to	explicitly	capture	evolving	topics	from	documents	that	cover	large	time	spans	 (e.g.	 centuries).	 To	 do	 that	we	would	 need	 to	 resort	 to	 a	more	 complicated	and	computationally	expensive	dynamic	topic	model	 (Blei	&	Lafferty	2006).	Such	an	approach	is	currently	not	feasible	 given	the	large	dataset	used	here	but	would	be	interesting	to	explore	in	future	work.	Nevertheless	the	assumption	of	document	 exchangeability	captures	the	fact	that	current	literature	builds	on	 top	of	previous	literature	but	is	a	limitation	for	topics	that	have	 radically	 changed	 in	 the	 way	 they	 are	 described	 (e.g.	 terminology)	 in	 literature.	 For	 example	 the	 field	 of	 atomic	 physics	was	 described	by	words	relating	to	�matter�	in	the	late	19th	century	 �electron�	in	middle	of	the	20th	century	and	�quantum�	in	the	late	 20th	 century.	 Likewise	 the	 field	 of	 neuroscience	 evolved	 from	 being	described	by	words	relating	to	�nerve�	to	�neuron�	to	�ca2�	 over	the	last	100	years	(Blei	&	Lafferty	2006).	The	dynamic	topic	 model	uses	a	sequence	of	 time	slices	 in	which	 topics	are	conditioned	on	the	previous	topics	which	is	a	limitation	of	the	standard	 LDA	model	used	in	this	study. 2.3?|?Creating the data set Taking	 into	consideration	 the	 issue	of	having	access	 to	 the	electronic	 version	of	 the	 text	we	decided	 to	 include	 in	 our	 analysis	 only journal articles as the majority of these are now available for download	from	online	databases.	Thus	we	have	excluded	books	 books	chapters	and	reports	something	that	may	have	introduced	 bias	 in	our	 results.	 Furthermore	 due	 to	 computational	 and	 time	 constraints we have limited the number of journals included in our	analysis.	Thus	the	total	volume	of	fisheries	publications	is	underestimated	 in	our	analysis	something	that	 limits	the	results	of	 this	study.	The	dataset	was	constructed	following	a	set	of	 inclusion criteria to obtain a diverse set of journals that reflect fisheries	 science	 while	 maintaining	 computational	 feasibility.	 First	 we	 included	 all	 journals	with	 the	 term	 �fisheries�	 or	 �fishery�	 in	 their	 title	 that	 are	 listed	by	 the	Fisheries	 Science	Citation	 Index	 Extended	 (SCIE)	2016	provided	by	Thomson	Reuters	and	having	 an	 impact	 factor	 of	 ?1.0.	 Second	 we	 included	 all	 journals	 from	 the	Fisheries	SCIE	2016	that	do	not	 include	these	words	 in	their	 titles	but	explicitly	address	fisheries	in	their	aims	and	scopes	and	 having	an	 impact	 factor	of	?1.0.	Third	we	 included	 the	 top	 four	 journals	with	the	highest	2016	 impact	factor	with	the	term	�marine�	in	their	title	indexed	by	any	list	from	SCIE	or	Social	Science	 Citation	Index	and	explicitly	addressing	fisheries	in	their	aims	and	 scopes.	All	journals	were	subject	to	the	University	of	Troms��The	 Arctic	University	of	Norway	subscription	rights.	A	total	of	21	journals	satisfied	these	criteria	(Table	1).	Although	journals	that	do	not	 match	these	criteria	also	publish	fisheries	research	such	journals	 were	not	 considered	 to	 be	 specialized	 fisheries	 research	outlets	 (e.g.	the	journal	Ecology and Society). Moreover	even	though	some	of	the	most	influential	and	highly	 cited	 fisheries	 papers	 are	 published	 in	 high-	impact	 journals	 such	 as Nature and Science	 they	only	marginally	contribute	 to	 the	 total	 number	of	papers	published	 in	 fisheries-	related	 journals.	 Including	 in	our	analysis	all	publications	from	Nature and Science would result in	a	high	number	of	fisheries-	irrelevant	topics	(e.g.	astrophysics)	as	 these	journals	typically	publish	a	broad	range	of	topics.

Another	example	 relates	 to	 the	 journal	 subscription	 rights	 which	did	not	allow	data	collection	for	all	years.	For	example	the	 Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences started in 1901 but	our	subscription	only	allowed	access	from	1996. All	articles	appeared	in	portable	document	format	(PDF)	and	were	 first	converted	to	their	plain	 text	 representation.	This	 resulted	 in	a	 complete	transformation	from	PDF	to	plain	text	for	all	elements	of	 each	article	including	the	header	title	author	info	affiliation	info	abstract	keywords	content	tables	bibliography	and	captions.	Several	 articles	mainly	 from	the	early	1990s	were	 image-	based	PDFs	that	 were	unsuitable	for	direct	conversion	from	PDF	to	plain	text.	In	these	 cases	 the	 Tesseract	 optical	 character	 recognition	 (OCR)	 software	 library	 was	 used	 to	 subsequently	 convert	 these	 articles	 into	 text-	 based	PDFs	and	then	to	their	plain	text	representation.	To	make	sure	 that	we	only	analysed	the	content	 text	of	each	article	we	used	an	 advanced	text	pattern	search	method	to	remove	boilerplate	content	 such	as	journal	information	article	metadata	acknowledgments	and	 bibliographies.	Additionally	multilanguage	abstracts	or	non-	English	 articles	(e.g.	articles	that	appeared	in	French)	were	also	removed. Latent	Dirichlet	allocation	is	a	bag-	of-	words	model	in	which	documents	are	represented	as	sequences	of	individual	word	features.	As	 such	every	document	was	tokenized.	Tokenization	is	the	process	of	 obtaining	individual	words	(also	known	as	unigrams)	from	sentences.	 Unigrams	 lose	 important	semantic	cues	 that	are	encoded	by	compound	words.	To	overcome	this	bigrams	were	included	by	combining	two	consecutive	unigrams	that	occurred	?20	times	within	each	 document.	As	a	result	compound	words	such	as	�rainbow	trout�	are	 preserved.	Additionally	we	used	named	entity	recognition	(NER)	a	 technique	 from	natural	 language	 processing	 (NLP)	 to	 retrieve	 entities	 related	to	names	nationalities	companies	 locations	objects	 etc.	 from	 the	 documents.	 Entities	 such	 as	 �the	 European	Union�	 �the	Norwegian	Research	Council�	or	�marine	protected	areas�	are	 thus	preserved	and	included	in	the	analysis.	The	inclusion	of	bigrams	 and	entities	allows	for	a	richer	bag-	of-	words	representation	than	a	 standard	unigram	representation. Although	 all	 tokens	 within	 a	 document	 serve	 an	 important	 function	for	topic	modelling	they	are	not	all	equally	important.	We	 proceed	 by	 filtering	 out	 numbers	 punctuation	 marks	 and	 single-	 character	 words	 as	 they	 bear	 no	 topical	 meaning.	 Furthermore	 we	removed	stop	words	(e.g.	the is a which)	words	that	occurred	 only	once	(e.g.	mainly	typos	and	incorrectly	hyphenated	words)	and	 words	 that	 occurred	 in	 ?90%	of	 the	 documents	 (e.g.	 result study show)	as	they	serve	no	discriminative	topical	significance.	Omitting	 frequently	occurring	words	prevents	 such	words	 from	dominating	 all	topics. For	grammatical	reasons	different	word	forms	or	derivationally	 related	words	can	have	a	similar	meaning	and	ideally	we	would	want	 such	terms	to	be	grouped.	Stemming	and	lemmatization	are	two	NLP	 techniques	to	reduce	inflectional	and	derivational	forms	of	words	to	 a	 common	base	 form.	Stemming	heuristically	 cuts	off	 derivational	 affixes	 to	 achieve	 some	normalization	 albeit	 crude	 in	most	 cases.	 Stemming	 loses	 the	 ability	 to	 relate	 stemmed	words	back	 to	 their	 F IGURE �1?The	number	of	publications	(y-	axis)	per	journal	(colour-	coded)	for	the	years	1990�2016	(x-	axis)	that	were	used	to	create	the	 latent	Dirichlet	allocation	model.	The	total	number	of	documents	was	46582 ?? ? | ?7SYED Et al. original	part	of	speech	such	as	verbs	or	nouns	and	decreases	the	 interpretability	of	 topics	 in	 later	 stages	 (Evangelopoulos	Zhang	&	 Prybutok	2012).	For	example	the	term	�fishing�	will	be	stemmed	to	 �fish�;	 likewise	�modeling�	will	be	stemmed	to	�model�	and	cannot	 be	returned	to	its	original	part	of	speech	(i.e.	verb).	Our	analysis	uses	 lemmatization	which	is	a	more	sophisticated	normalization	method	 that	uses	a	vocabulary	and	morphological	analysis	to	reduce	words	 to their base form called lemma. It is best described by its most basic example	normalizing	the	verbs	�am�	�are�	�is�	to	�be�	although	such	 terms	will	be	filtered	out	from	our	analysis.	Likewise	lemmatization	 correctly	normalizes	�fisheries�	and	�fishery�	and	�policies�	and	�policy.�	 Additionally	 uppercase	 and	 lowercase	 words	 were	 grouped.	 The	 final	 corpus	 consisted	 of	 46582	 full-	text	 publications	 with	 around	130	million	words	and	170000	unique	words. 2.4?|?Creating the LDA model Latent	 Dirichlet	 allocation	 assumes	 that	 the	 number	 of	 topics	 to	 uncover	is	known	in	advance	and	is	set	by	the	K-	parameter.	As	the	 optimal	number	of	 topics	 is	not	known	 in	advance	we	created	50	 different	 LDA	 models	 by	 varying	 the	 K-	parameter	 from	 1	 to	 50.	 Measures	to	determine	the	optimal	LDA	model	are	described	in	the	 next	section.	The	LDA	models	are	created	using	the	Python	library	 Gensim	(Rehurek	&	Sojka	2010).	Since	LDA	is	a	Bayesian	probabilistic	model	we	can	incorporate	some	prior	knowledge	into	the	model.	 Prior	 knowledge	 can	 be	 encoded	 by	 symmetrical	 or	 asymmetrical	 Dirichlet	 priors.	 A	 symmetrical	 prior	 distribution	 of	 topics	 within	 documents	assumes	that	all	topics	have	an	equal	probability	of	being	 assigned	 to	 a	 document.	 Such	 an	 assumption	 ignores	 that	 certain	 topics	 are	 more	 prominent	 in	 a	 document	 collection	 and	 consequently	would	logically	have	a	higher	probability	to	be	assigned	to	 a	document.	Conversely	specific	topics	are	less	common	and	thus	 not	 appropriately	 reflected	 with	 a	 symmetrical	 prior	 distribution.	 Logically	speaking	an	asymmetrical	prior	would	capture	this	 intuition	and	would	 therefore	be	the	preferred	choice	 (Syed	&	Spruit	 2018;	Wallach	Mimno	&	Mccallum	2009).	Additionally	we	 iteratively	optimize	the	prior	using	the	Newton�Rapson	method	(Huang	 2005)	by	learning	it	from	the	data.	To	infer	the	hidden	variables	(i.e.	 inferring	the	posterior	distribution	of	the	hidden	variables	given	the	 observed	 documents)	 we	 use	 variational	 inference	 called	 �online	 LDA�	(Hoffman	Blei	&	Bach	2010). 2.5?|?Calculating model quality Analogous	to	choosing	the	right	number	of	clusters	for	techniques	 such as k-	nearest	neighbours	choosing	the	right	number	topics	is	an	 important	 task	 in	 topic	modelling	 including	 LDA	 to	 appropriately	 capture	the	underlying	topics	in	a	dataset.	A	low	number	of	topics	 will	result	in	a	few	too	broad	topics	with	high	values	capturing	meaningless	topics;	such	topics	are	merely	the	result	of	the	statistical	nature	of	LDA.	Several	approaches	to	determine	the	optimal	number	of	 topics	have	been	proposed.	One	such	approach	is	to	fit	various	topic	 models	to	a	training	set	of	documents	and	calculate	a	model	fit	on	a	 test	set	(held-	out	data)	(Scott	&	Baldridge	2013).	The	model	that	fits	 best on the test set would be considered a better model. However topic	models	are	used	by	humans	to	interpret	and	explore	the	documents and there is no technical reason that the best- fitted model would	aid	best	in	this	task	(Blei	2012).	In	fact	research	has	shown	 that	such	measures	negatively	correlate	with	human	interpretation	 (Chang	Gerrish	Wang	&	Blei	2009). Another	approach	is	to	assess	the	quality	of	topics	with	human	 topic	ranking	which	 is	considered	the	gold	standard	when	assessing	 the	 interpretability	 of	 generated	 topics.	 Such	 ranking	 is	 often	 based	on	word	or	 topic	 intrusion	 tests	 in	which	an	 intruder	word	 or	topic	needs	to	be	recognized	within	a	set	of	related	or	cohesive	 words	or	topics	(Chang	et	al.	2009).	However	this	approach	is	time-	 consuming	 and	 expensive	 as	 for	 every	 created	 topic	 model	 (e.g.	 1�50)	and	for	every	topic	within	that	model	the	interpretability	of	 individual words and sets of words needs to be assessed. To circumvent	this	a	more	quantitative	approach	is	preferred	while	maintaining	human	interpretability.	One	way	is	to	assess	the	quality	of	topics	 with coherence measures that are based on the distributional hypothesis	(Harris	1954)	which	states	that	words	with	similar	meanings	 tend	 to	 co-	occur	 within	 similar	 contexts.	 Such	 an	 approach	 drawing	 on	 the	 philosophical	 premise	 that	 a	 set	 of	 statements	 or	 facts	 is	said	to	be	coherent	if	 its	statements	or	facts	support	each	 other	informs	us	about	the	understandability	and	interpretability	of	 topics	from	a	human	perspective.	This	study	utilized	the	CV coherence	measure	(R�der	Both	&	Hinneburg	2015)	which	has	shown	 the	highest	correlation	with	all	available	human	topic	ranking	data	 and	is	thus	an	appropriate	quantitative	approach	(see	supplementary	 material	 for	 an	 extensive	 and	mathematical	 explanation	 of	 the	CV coherence	measure).	The	CV	coherence	score	 for	all	50	LDA	models	was	calculated	and	an	elbow	method	estimating	the	(inflection)	 point	where	 adding	more	 topics	will	 not	 increase	 coherence	was	 used	to	obtain	the	optimal	number	of	topics. 2.6?|?Labelling topics As	previously	described	the	topical	structure	that	permeates	the	document	collection	is	latent	and	the	probability	distributions	of	words	 (i.e.	topics)	are	not	semantically	labelled	(i.e.	they	are	not	given	a	name	 by	the	LDA	model).	When	sorted	the	top	10	or	top	15	high	probability	words	within	each	topic	are	used	to	describe	the	topic.	However	 algorithmic	analyses	of	content	remain	limited	in	their	capacity	to	understand	latent	meanings	or	the	subtleties	of	human	language	(Lewis	 Zamith	&	Hermida	2013)	and	manual	labelling	is	still	considered	the	 gold	standard	in	topic	modelling	(Lau	et	al.	2011).	Thus	the	labelling	 of	each	topic	 (i.e.	giving	a	name	to	each	topic;	e.g.	a	topic	with	the	 five	most	probable	words	being	�pig�	�cow�	�sheep�	�goat�	�horse�	 would	be	labelled	as	�domestic	animals�)	was	performed	by	a	human	 analyst	that	is	a	fisheries	domain	expert.	When	identifying	the	common	subject	of	 each	 topic	 (i.e.	 the	name	or	 the	 label	of	 the	 topic)	 the	analyst	used	 the	 following	procedure.	First	 the	analyst	 closely	 inspected	the	15	most	probable	words	from	each	topic.	Second	the	 analyst	inspected	the	titles	of	the	documents	in	the	dataset	that	were	 8? |? ?? SYED Et al. included	by	the	topic	model	in	that	respective	topic.	The	interested	 reader	 can	 find	 a	 sample	of	 publication	 titles	 that	 have	high	probability	within	a	single	topic	 in	Table	S1	of	the	supplementary	material.	 Third	 based	on	 the	previous	 two	 steps	 the	 analyst	 labelled	 a	 topic	(i.e.	gave	it	a	name;	e.g.	if	the	LDA	model	included	in	topic	1	the	 words	�pig�	�cow�	�farm�	and	the	titles	of	the	documents	 included	 by	the	model	in	this	topic	have	in	common	the	subject	of	domestic	 animals	then	the	analyst	gave	topic	1	the	label	of	�domestic	animals�).	 Furthermore	to	validate	the	labelling	of	the	topics	we	visualized	the	 topics	in	a	two-	dimensional	area	by	computing	the	distance	between	 topics	(Chuang	Ramage	Manning	&	Heer	2012)	and	applying	multidimensional	scaling	(Sievert	&	Shirley	2014).	This	two-	dimensional	 topic	representation	displays	the	similarity	between	topics	with	respect	 to	 their	word	 distribution	 over	 topics	 that	 is	 the	words	 and	 their	corresponding	probability	within	the	topic.	Clustering	and	overlapping	nodes	indicate	similar	word	distributions	and	the	surface	of	 the	node	indicates	the	relative	topic	prevalence	in	the	complete	set	of	 documents.	The	topic	prevalence	indicates	how	widespread	a	topic	is	 within	all	the	documents	as	all	topic	proportions	add	up	to	100%.	In	 a	fourth	step	the	analyst	used	this	visualization	in	order	to	validate	 the	choice	of	 the	 final	 label	 for	each	 topic	 (e.g.	 topics	using	similar	 vocabulary	 usually	 refer	 to	 similar	 subjects;	 thus	 for	 example	 the	 topics	labelled	by	the	analyst	�domestic	animals�	and	�astrophysics�	 appearing	close	together	in	the	two-	dimensional	topic	representation	 would	raise	suspicions	and	the	analyst	would	have	to	go	through	the	 labelling	procedure	again	in	order	to	find	labels	that	make	sense	for	 the	two	vocabulary-	close	topics).	The	labels	were	further	validated	in	 a	fifth	step	as	described	in	the	section	Validation	of	Results. 2.7?|?Calculating topical trends over time To	gain	 insight	 into	the	topical	temporal	dynamics	of	the	fisheries	field	 we	 aggregated	 the	 document	 topic	 proportions	 for	 each	 year	 and	 for	 every	individual	topic	into	a	composite	topic-	year	proportion	(see	supplementary	material).	Doing	so	provides	a	sense	of	how	the	prevalence	of	 each	topic	within	fisheries	science	publications	has	changed	over	the	last	 26	years.	Additionally	to	obtain	insight	into	increasing	and	decreasing	topical	trends	we	fit	a	one-	dimensional	least	square	polynomial	for	different	 time	intervals.	The	polynomial	coefficient	is	used	as	a	proxy	for	the	trend	 and	defines	the	slope	of	the	composite	topic-	year	proportions	for	a	range	 of years.	Coefficients	are	multiplied	by	the	number	of	years	within	each	 time	interval	to	obtain	the	change	measured	in	percentage	points.	Positive	 values	indicate	increasing	or	hot	topics	and	negative	values	decreasing	or	 cold	topics.	The	time	intervals	allow	for	historical	comparisons	between	 1990�95	1995�2000	2000�05	2005�10	and	2010�16.	Colour	coding	 is	used	to	resemble	the	hot	(i.e.	red)	and	cold	(i.e.	blue)	topical	trends. 2.8?|?Calculating topic over journals Following	a	similar	approach	as	topical	trends	over	time	we	aggregate	topic	proportion	per	journal	to	gain	insight	into	how	topics	are	 covered	by	the	journals	included	in	this	study.	Doing	so	enables	us	 to identify broadly oriented or more focused oriented journals. Note that	aggregation	of	topic	proportions	is	handled	per	journal	and	covers	only	the	years	for	which	articles	are	downloaded	(see	Table	1).	 For	example	for	the	journal	Fish and Fisheries	journal	topic	distributions	cover	the	time	range	2000�16	whereas	the	journal	ICES Journal of Marine Science	covers	the	complete	time	range	of	1990�2016. 2.9?|?Relaxing LDA assumptions and future research directions At	the	time	of	writing	the	original	LDA	method	proposed	by	Blei	 et	al.	(2003)	had	over	20000	citations.	The	technique	has	received	 much	 attention	 from	 machine-	learning	 researchers	 and	 other	 scholars	and	has	been	adopted	and	extended	in	a	variety	of	ways.	 More	concretely	relaxing	the	assumptions	behind	LDA	can	result	 in	 richer	 representations	 of	 the	 underlying	 semantic	 structures.	 The	 bag-	of-	words	 assumption	 has	 been	 relaxed	 by	 conditioning	 words	on	 the	previous	words	 (i.e.	Markovian	 structure)	 (Wallach	 2006);	 the	document	exchangeability	 assumption	 relaxed	by	 the	 previously	mentioned	dynamic	topic	model	(Blei	&	Lafferty	2006)	 and	 the	 Bayesian	 nonparametric	 model	 can	 be	 utilized	 to	 automatically	uncover	the	number	of	topics	(Whye	Teh	Jordan	Beal	&	 Blei	2004).	Furthermore	LDA	has	been	extended	in	various	ways.	 Topics	might	correlate	as	a	topic	about	�cars�	is	more	likely	to	also	 be	about	�emission�	than	it	is	about	�diseases.�	The	Dirichlet	distribution	 is	 implicitly	 independent	 and	a	more	 flexible	distribution	 such	 as	 the	 logistic	 normal	 is	 a	more	 appropriate	 distribution	 to	 capture	 covariance	 between	 topics.	 The	 correlated	 topic	 model	 aids	in	this	task	(Blei	&	Lafferty	2007).	Other	examples	extending	 LDA	include	the	author-	topic	model	(Rosen-	Zvi	Griffiths	Steyvers	 &	Smyth	2004)	the	relational	topic	model	(Chang	&	Blei	2010)	the	 spherical	 topic	model	 (Reisinger	Waters	 Silverthorn	&	Mooney	 2010)	the	sparse	topic	model	(Wang	&	Blei	2009)	and	the	bursty	 topic	model	 (Doyle	&	Elkan	2009).	Apart	from	its	applicability	to	 text	LDA	can	be	applied	 to	audio	 (Kim	Narayanan	&	Sundaram	 2009)	 video	 (Mehran	Oyama	&	Shah	2009)	and	 image	 (Fergus	 Fei-	Fei	Perona	&	Zisserman	2005)	data.	Those	topic	models	that	 relax	or	extend	the	original	LDA	model	bring	additional	computational	complexity	and	their	own	sets	of	limitations	and	challenges;	 nevertheless	 it	 would	 be	 interesting	 to	 explore	 these	models	 in	 future research. 3? |?RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 3.1?|?Uncovering fisheries topics The	LDA	model	with	 the	optimal	 coherence	 score	 contains	25	 topics	 (k = 25).

One-	third	 of	all	the	topics	are	using	the	word	�fishery�/�fisheries�	infrequently:	 (2)	Morphology	(7)	Biochemistry	(10)	North	Atlantic	(13)	Genetics	 (15)	 Growth	 experiments	 (17)	 Growth	 (18)	 Tracking	 and	moving	 (22)	Salmonids.	Another	one-	third	of	all	of	the	topics	does	not	use	 this	word	almost	at	all:	(5)	Non-	fish	species	(6)	Corals	(9)	Diet	(11)	 Southern	 Hemisphere	 (12)	 Development	 (14)	 Assemblages	 (20)	 Primary	production	(21)	Models	(23)	Acoustics	and	swimming. Considering	all	the	25	topics	only	one	[i.e.	(25)	Fisheries	management]	 refers	 explicitly	 to	 the	human	dimension	 component	of	 the	fishery	system	something	that	confirms	our	working	hypothesis	that	the	human	dimension	of	fisheries	is	under-	represented	in	 the	 fisheries	 specialty	 literature.	 To	 evaluate	whether	 the	 human	 dimension	 of	 fisheries	 as	 SECASs	 is	 further	 refined	 within	 the	 Fisheries	management	 topic	 following	 the	 same	methodology	 as	 described	 above	we	 created	 a	new	LDA	model	 that	 zooms	 in	on	 this	 topic	 thereby	 creating	 subtopics	 from	 the	 broader	 Fisheries	 management	 topic.	The	new	model	uncovered	12	subtopics	 from	 the	 topic	 Fisheries	management	 (Table	3)	 out	 of	 which	 eight	 assign	higher	probability	to	the	term	�fishery�/�fisheries�	(i.e.	use	this	 word	often	or	moderately)	and	thus	were	considered	directly	relating	 to	 fisheries:	 three	 on	 various	management	 approaches	 (i.e.	 Co-	management	 Precautionary	 approach	 and	 Quota	 systems);	 three	 on	 economics	 (i.e.	 Markets	 Bioeconomics	 and	 Blue	 economy);	 and	 two	 on	 type	 of	 fishery	 (i.e.	 Small-	scale	 fisheries	 and	 Recreational	fisheries). Out	of	 the	 total	of	25	 topics	uncovered	by	our	 analysis	 three	 were	 considered	 generic	 [i.e.	 (10)	 North	 Atlantic	 (11)	 Southern	 Hemisphere	(21)	Models)].	Out	of	the	remaining	22	topics	20	cover	 the	 natural	 dimension	 of	 fisheries	 reasonably	 mirroring	 the	 curriculum	of	fisheries	biology	and	fisheries	ecology	higher	education	 courses	 (e.g.	 Jennings	Kaiser	&	Reynolds	 2009;	King	 2007)	 but	 not	addressing	topics	such	as	climate	change.	However	considering	 the	focus	of	the	two	remaining	topics	that	is	(1)	Conservation	and	 (25)	Fisheries	management	it	is	apparent	that	the	research	focus	in	 fisheries	during	the	last	26	years	has	not	entirely	captured	the	complexity	of	the	fisheries	domain	especially	of	the	human	dimension	 component	something	also	observed	for	specialized	research	areas	 such	 as	 for	 example	 by-	catch	 reduction	 technology	 (Campbell	 &	 Cornwell	2008;	Molina	&	Cooke	2012).	These	results	seem	to	be	 confirmed	 by	 the	 bibliometric	 analyses	 published	 in	 Aksnes	 and	 Browman	(2016)	and	Jari?	et	al.	(2012)	where	no	human	dimension-	 related	words	were	identified	among	the	most	frequent	words	used	 in	fisheries	publication	titles	and	abstracts.	This	situation	might	not	 be	 surprising	 given	 the	 institutional	 context	 in	which	 fisheries	 research	is	performed.

SYED Et al. for	the	Exploration	of	the	Sea	(ICES)	which	is	one	of	the	most	important	 fisheries-	related	 intergovernmental	 organization	 despite	 having	along	the	years	various	groups	working	more	or	less	directly	 working	with	different	aspects	of	this	human	dimension	now	only	 one	out	of	more	than	45	expert	groups	is	working	explicitly	with	this	 dimension	 of	 fisheries.	 This	 group	 the	 Strategic	 Initiative	 Human	 Dimension	became	operational	in	2015. Persisting	in	having	this	heavily	unbalanced	focus	between	the	 two	dimensions	of	fisheries	systems	(i.e.	the	human	dimension	[i.e.	 human	agents	communities	of	these	and	their	institutions]	and	the	 natural	dimension	[i.e.	biotic	such	as	predator	species	and	prey	species	and	abiotic	such	as	water	temperature	and	nutrients])	will	not	 help	in	understanding	the	behaviour	of	fisheries	stakeholders	(from	 fishers	 to	consumers)	 leading	 to	unintended	and	 too	often	undesirable	management	outcomes	(Fulton	Smith	Smith	&	van	Putten	 2011)	 and	 thus	 unsustainable	 fisheries.	 Responding	 to	 the	 challenges	posed	by	sustainable	fisheries	necessitates	the	development	 of	stronger	networks	within	the	family	of	human	dimension	sciences	 and	across	disciplinary	boundaries	with	 the	natural	dimension	sciences	(Symes	&	Hoefnagel	2010).	Without	providing	an	exhaustive	 list and in random order the human dimension in fisheries could be included	in	fisheries	science	by	addressing	topics	such	as	institutional	 aspects	(enforcement	and	compliance	policy	interactions	etc.)	social	aspects	(gender	religion/beliefs	welfare	social	cohesion	social	 networks	education	and	learning	human	agency	health	safety	and	 security	 at	 sea	 food	 security	 perception	 attitudes	 social	 norms	 compliance	mental	models	 of	 various	 actors	 involved	 in	 fisheries	 etc.)	 economic	 aspects	 (poverty	 innovation	 distribution	of	 benefits	spiritual	 inspirational	and	aesthetic	services	of	fisheries	etc.)	 political	aspects	(power	structures	transparency	etc.)	and	cultural	 aspects	(traditional/local	ecological	knowledge	history	cultural	dimensions	 culinary	 choices	 heritage	blue	humanities	 fisheries	 literacy	etc.)	(Charles	2001;	De	Young	Charles	&	Hjort	2008;	ICES	 2016;	�sterblom	et	al.	2013;	Sowman	2011;	Spalding	Biedenweg	 Hettinger	&	Nelson	2017;	Stone-	Jovicich	2015). Continuing	our	analysis	three	topic	clusters	can	be	identified	in	 Figure	2	indicating	a	similar	probability	distribution	over	words	(i.e.	 topics	that	are	to	some	extent	related	to	the	words	they	use	to	describe	the	theme):	a	growth	cluster	[the	topics	Growth	experiments	 (15)	Diet	(9)	Non-	fish	species	(5)	Primary	production;	Development	 (12)	 Reproduction	 (4)	 and	 Growth	 (17)];	 an	 institutions	 cluster	 [the	 topics	 Fisheries	management	 (25)	 and	 Conservation	 (1)];	 and	 a	salmonids	cluster	 [the	topics	Freshwater	 (8)	Tracking	and	movement	 (18)	and	Salmonids	 (22);	one	would	expect	 to	 find	here	also	 the	 topic	 Salmon	 (3)	 but	 interestingly	 from	 a	 linguistics	 point	 of	 view	this	topic	seems	rather	isolated].	The	most	isolated	topics	are	 Morphology	(2)	and	Biochemistry	(7)	indicating	most	probably	the	 use	of	a	very	specific	topic	distribution	over	words. The	most	 frequent	aquatic	organisms	mentioned	 in	our	corpus	 are	 salmonids	 (e.g.	 salmon	 trout)	 and	 other	 freshwater	 organisms	 (e.g.	perch);	shark	(within	the	topic	Reproduction);	crab	mussel	and	 oyster	 (within	 the	 topic	 Non-	fish	 species);	 cod	 lamprey	 and	 herring	(within	the	topic	North	Atlantic);	whale	 (within	topic	Southern	 Hemisphere);	 sturgeon	 (within	 the	 topic	Growth);	 tuna	 (within	 the	 topic	Fishing	gear);	and	shrimp	(within	topic	Estuaries).	Commercially	 important	species	such	as	anchoveta	pollock	and	tilapia	were	not	 included	among	 the	most	 frequent	words	of	 any	of	 the	25	 topics.	 These	findings	are	relatively	consistent	with	Aksnes	and	Browman	 (2016)	and	Jari?	et	al.	(2012)	who	reported	that	the	most	frequently	 studied	group	of	species	was	the	Salmonidae	followed	by	the	Atlantic	 cod	and	that	there	is	no	correlation	between	the	production	of	various	species	and	the	number	of	publications	about	these	species. Aquaculture	has	not	been	 identified	as	a	topic	of	 its	own	in	our	 dataset and the word aquaculture	was	not	included	in	the	top	10	most	 frequent	words	of	any	of	the	25	topics.	However	the	word	aquaculture was	included	in	the	top	10	most	frequent	words	for	the	subtopic	Blue	 economy	under	the	topic	Fisheries	management	possibly	indicating	 the	interest	 in	this	relatively	new	industry	in	a	context	that	focuses	 on	increasing	economic	activities	in	the	marine	and	maritime	sector. With	regard	to	the	typology	of	fishers	by	Charles	(2001)	only	the	 recreational	type	is	specifically	mentioned	among	the	most	frequent	 words	 in	 our	 corpus	with	 the	word	angler	 included	 in	 the	 topic	 (8)	 Freshwater.	This	might	be	because	the	research	focusing	on	the	other	 types	 (e.g.	 subsistence	 artisanal)	 does	 not	 employ	 a	 very	 specific	 vocabulary	or	that	there	might	be	a	lag	in	research	on	for	example	 small-	scale	and	artisanal	fishery	(Purcell	&	Pomeroy	2015).	However	 if	we	 look	only	at	 topic	 (25)	Fisheries	management	 the	recreational	 type	and	small-	scale	type	have	each	its	subtopic	indicating	that	from	 a	management	 perspective	 these	 two	 types	 of	 fisheries	 have	been	 relatively	extensively	explored	by	fisheries	scientists. Out	 of	 the	 25	 topics	 uncovered	 by	 our	 LDA	model	 two	 refer	 to	 large	 geographical	 areas:	 the	North	 Atlantic	 (10)	 and	 Southern	 Hemisphere	 (11).	 The	 words	 Norwegian	 (within	 the	 topic	 North	 Atlantic)	 and	 Florida	 [within	 the	 topic	 Estuaries	 (25)]	 are	 the	 only	 specific	 geographical	 references	 among	 the	 top	10	most	probable	 words.	These	very	few	specific	geographical	references	might	indicate that most of the fisheries research is focused on a few areas around	 the	globe	 leaving	 large	 zones	underexplored	 as	 also	 indicated	in	Molina	and	Cooke	(2012)	or	that	research	about	other	regions	is	published	in	other	languages	than	English. 3.2?|?Topic proportions within documents For	every	document	the	LDA	model	infers	the	topical	decomposition	indicating	which	topics	are	found	in	that	document	and	in	what	 proportions.	The	assumptions	behind	LDA	cause	documents	to	exhibit	mainly	a	small	number	of	main	 topics	with	other	 topics	very	 close	to	zero	(note	that	all	topics	per	document	sum	up	to	1).	This	 structure	 assumes	 that	 documents	 are	 often	 about	 some	 topics	 rather	than	being	about	all	topics	equally.	Following	this	line	of	reasoning	we	analysed	the	remaining	topic	proportions	for	documents	 exhibiting	one	of	the	topics	as	the	dominant	topic	this	being	defined	 as	the	document�s	topic	proportion	that	exceeds	all	other	topic	proportions.	Such	an	analysis	provides	insight	into	the	document	composition	that	comes	from	the	mixing	topic	proportions	that	is	what	 topics	co-	occur	together	within	fisheries	research	articles. ?? ? | ?13SYED Et al. Figure	4	shows	the	average	remaining	topic	proportions	with	respect	to	the	dominant	topic	displayed	as	a	heat	map.	The	dominant	 topic	 shown	on	 the	 left	 (i.e.	 rows)	 has	 the	average	dominant	 topic	 proportion	within	parentheses.	A	higher	number	 indicates	that	more	 of	 the	 document	 content	 deals	with	 the	 dominant	 topic	while	 the	 other	topics	make	up	the	smaller	remaining	portion	of	the	document.	 Conversely	 lower	 numbers	 reflect	 a	 dominant	 topic	 making	 up	 a	 smaller	portion	of	the	document	leaving	more	room	for	other	topics	 to	be	part	of	that	document.	For	example	documents	dealing	with	the	 topic	Fishing	gear	are	on	average	allocating	45%	of	their	content	to	 their	own	topic	 leaving	55%	of	the	remaining	content	to	other	topics	(for	example	9%	to	the	topic	Models	and	between	4%	and	6%	to	 each	of	 the	 topics	Fisheries	management	Acoustics	 and	 swimming	 Stock	 assessment	 and	 Southern	Hemisphere).	 Furthermore	 the	 remaining	average	topic	proportions	shown	at	the	top	(i.e.	columns)	are	 sorted	from	high	to	low	and	reflect	which	topics	more	frequently	or	 to	a	higher	extent	co-	occur	with	other	topics.	For	example	given	any	 document	with	a	dominant	topic	the	remaining	topic	proportion	deals	 more	often	with	the	topics	Models	Stock	assessment	Fish	reproduction	or	Growth	experiments	(i.e.	these	three	topics	have	the	highest	 co-	occurrence)	and	less	often	with	the	topics	Salmonids	Genetics	or	 Salmon	(i.e.	these	three	topics	have	the	lowest	co-	occurrence). Documents	dealing	with	 the	most	prevalent	 topic	 in	 the	corpus	 directly	relating	to	fisheries	that	is	Fisheries	management	allocate	to	 F IGURE �4?Heat	map	displaying	the	dominant	topic	(left)	and	the	remaining	average	topic	proportions	(top)	for	all	46582	documents	 from	the	corpus.	This	indicates	the	extent	to	which	documents	about	one	main	topic	relate	to	the	other	uncovered	topics	(i.e.	the	degree	 of	topic	co-	occurrence)	decreasing	from	left	to	right.	For	example	documents	that	primarily	focus	on	Fisheries	management	also	focus	on	 Conservation	(12.7%)	or	Fishing	gear	(5.3%) 14? |? ?? SYED Et al. this	topic	almost	60%	of	their	content	about	13%	to	Conservation	and	 between	3%	and	5%	to	topics	such	as	(in	descending	order):	Fishing	 gear	Models	and	Stock	assessment.	Documents	dealing	with	the	most	 prevalent	topic	in	the	rest	of	the	corpus	that	is	Primary	production	 allocate	to	this	topic	55%	of	their	content	and	between	3%	and	6%	to	 topics	such	as	(in	descending	order):	Non-	fish	species	Biochemistry	 Models	Diet	Southern	Hemisphere	and	Growth	experiments. Co-	occurrence	 of	 such	 topics	 might	 be	 something	 natural.	 However	it	would	be	interesting	to	consider	whether	other	mixtures	 of	topics	would	bring	novel	and	possibly	also	innovative	insight	into	 fisheries	science.	Such	an	insight	is	highly	needed	in	order	to	achieve	 sustainable	 fisheries	 exploitation	 and	 implement	 the	 fisheries-	 related	 actions	 of	 the	 international	 ocean	 governance	 objectives	 (European	Commission	2016). 3.3?|?Topical trends over time and topic prevalence To	gain	insight	into	the	temporal	changes	of	topics	we	display	the	topical	trend	values	and	topic	prevalence	in	Figure	5.	The	left-	hand	side	 displays	the	fitted	increase	(hot	topics)	or	decrease	(cold	topics)	in	percentage	points	for	different	time	intervals	and	represents	the	change	 in	 composite	 topic-	year	 proportions	 within	 a	 certain	 time	 frame.

Individual	trend	lines	for	the	25	broad	fisheries	topics	as	well	as	the	 topical	trends	and	prevalence	for	the	Fisheries	management	subtopics	 can	be	found	in	the	supplementary	material�Figures	S1�S3. With	regard	to	the	groups	of	topics	described	in	Table	2	during	 the	entire	period	of	26	years	taken	together	the	11	topics	referring	 to	aquatic	organisms	biology	themes	made	up	40%	of	the	corpus;	 the	groups	of	topics	on	the	themes	of	specific	species	modelling	 management	 and	 habitats	 between	 11%	 and	 14%	 each;	 the	 two	 topics	on	the	theme	of	geographical	regions	7%	together;	and	the	 fishing	gear	topic	almost	5%.	The	topics	Models	Primary	production	and	Fisheries	management	are	the	most	prevalent	in	the	corpus	 during	the	entire	period	of	26	years	with	approximately	7%	6.5%	 and	6%	respectively	from	the	total	number	of	documents.	The	topics	Salmon	Salmonids	and	Morphology	are	the	least	prevalent	with	 only	around	2%	of	the	corpus	accounting	for	each.	The	topic	Models	 has	 been	 among	 the	 top	 three	most	 prevalent	 topics	 since	 1995.	 Primary	production	was	the	most	prevalent	topic	in	the	first	three	 time	periods	we	analysed	(from	1990	to	2005).	Topics	directly	relating	to	fisheries	such	as	Fisheries	management	and	Stock	assessment	were	among	the	top	3	of	most	prevalent	topics	in	the	period	 2005�10	 (both	topics)	and	2010�16	 (only	Fisheries	management).	 The	topic	Conservation	joined	this	top	during	the	last	6	years. Taken	together	topics	that	could	be	grouped	as	relating	to	freshwater	fisheries	(i.e.	Freshwater	Tracking	and	movement	Salmonids	 Salmon	Estuaries	Assemblages)	 account	 for	one-	sixth	of	 the	 corpus.	These	results	corroborated	with	the	declining	interest	in	these	 topics	in	the	last	16	years	(see	Figure	5)	confirm	the	findings	of	Jari?	 et	al.	(2012)	that	indicate	a	general	decline	in	the	frequency	of	studies focused on freshwater habitats. The	top	four	hottest	topics	of	the	last	26	years	(overall	column)	are	 (in	 descending	 order):	 Fisheries	management	 Conservation	Models	 and	Fishing	gear	 (with	Stock	assessment	 the	 third	 topic	directly	 relating	to	fisheries	in	7th	place).	The	interest	in	models	has	also	been	 confirmed	by	Jari?	et	al.	(2012)	and	this	in	addition	to	the	prevalence	 of	the	modelling	topics	which	was	described	above	provides	empirical	evidence	for	the	fact	that	modelling	is	one	of	the	most	important	 research	 methods	 in	 fisheries	 science	 (Angelini	 &	 Moloney	 2007).	 The	topic	Fisheries	management	the	third	most	prevalent	topic	in	the	 corpus	remained	among	the	top	three	hottest	topics	during	the	last	 11	years	while	it	was	the	coldest	topic	in	the	first	half	on	the	1990s. The	configuration	of	top	three	hottest	and	top	three	coldest	topics	 has	 fluctuated	 during	 the	 five	 time	 periods	we	 have	 analysed.	 However	the	topic	Primary	production	has	constantly	been	ranked	 among	the	coldest	topics	(with	the	topic	Biochemistry	also	being	in	 this	top	in	the	period	1990�2005).	Overall	the	26-	year	period	it	is	 interesting	to	note	that	Primary	production	was	the	most	prevalent	 topic	but	at	the	same	time	had	the	steepest	decline	in	interest.	The	 topics	Models	and	Conservation	have	been	a	constant	occurrence	in	 the	top	three	hottest	topics	since	the	turn	of	the	Century	whereas	 the	 topic	 Fisheries	 management	 only	 joined	 this	 top	 category	 in	 2005.	Another	topic	directly	relating	to	fisheries	Fishing	gear	was	 part	of	this	top	in	the	period	2000�05. The	 increased	 prevalence	 in	 the	 corpus	 of	 the	 topic	 Fisheries	 gear	and	the	constant	interest	shown	in	this	topic	together	with	the	 constant	prevalence	in	the	corpus	of	the	topic	Stock	assessment	and	 the	constant	interest	shown	in	this	topic	indicate	that	fishing	gear	 and	stock	assessment	have	been	 the	central	elements	of	 fisheries	 science	in	the	last	26	years.	The	increasing	prevalence	and	interest	 in	the	topic	Fisheries	management	might	indicate	the	strengthening	 of	the	connection	between	fisheries	science	and	management	processes	in	the	light	of	the	growing	concern	about	the	status	of	fish	 stocks	worldwide.	Stock	assessments	provide	a	scientific	and	quantitative	basis	to	the	process	of	developing	and	implementing	a	management	plan	 (Hoggarth	Mees	&	O�Neill	2005)	and	as	 such	are	 indispensable	to	management	processes	(Hoggarth	et	al.	2006).	The	 interest	 in	the	topics	Growth	and	Reproduction	seems	to	be	most	 stable	among	all	the	25	topics	when	looking	at	the	entire	period	of	 26	years	even	though	the	prevalence	of	these	topics	is	rather	small	 (around	3%).	The	constant	interest	in	the	latter	can	be	explained	by	 the	 importance	 of	 fisheries	 reproduction	 for	 fisheries	 assessment	 and	management	(Jakobsen	Fogarty	Megrey	&	Moksness	2016). 3.4?|?Topical trends over journals Although	many	 journals	 included	 in	our	analysis	overlap	 to	some	 extent	in	their	content	it	is	possible	to	identify	journals	that	seem	 specialized	 in	specific	topics	 (Figure	6).

The	top	three	journals	 publishing	 this	 topic	 are	 ICES Journal of Marine Science Fisheries Oceanography and Fish and Fisheries	with	10%�11%	of	the	publication	space	of	each	of	these	journals	covering	this	topic. 3.5?|?Validation of results We	validated	 the	output	of	 the	LDA	model	 (including	 its	 labelling)	by	 comparing	the	hot/cold	LDA	topics	in	the	period	2000�09	with	the	hot/ cold	words	used	 in	publication	 titles	 in	 the	same	period	 identified	by	 the	bibliometric	study	of	Jari?	et	al.

Likewise	some	of	the	words	with	the	largest	decrease	in	 frequency	can	be	directly	linked	to	some	of	the	cold	topics	identified	by	 the	LDA	analysis	over	the	same	period	for	example	Atlantic in the bibliometric	study	relates	to	the	topic	North	Atlantic	identified	by	our	study;	 growth	to	the	topics	Growth	(17)	and	Growth	experiments	(15);	recruitment	to	the	topic	Stock	assessment	(14);	feeding	to	the	topic	Diet	(9). 4? |?CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS From	the	analysis	of	more	than	46500	full-	text	articles	published	in	 21	top	fisheries	journals	it	is	apparent	that	during	the	last	26	years	 the	 research	 focus	of	 fisheries	science	has	been	predominately	on	 the	 natural	 dimension	 of	 the	 fisheries	 system	with	 22	 out	 of	 25	 topics	 referring	 to	 this	 dimension.	While	 the	natural	 dimension	of	 fisheries	was	split	into	various	aspects	covering	topics	from	specific	 species	to	fish	catch	technology	the	human	dimension	was	explicitly	expressed	only	through	one	albeit	the	hottest	topic	in	the	data	 set	and	the	second	most	prevalent:	Fisheries	management.	Although	 there	is	undoubtedly	some	scientific	production	addressing	various	 aspects	of	the	human	dimension	of	fisheries	it	could	be	that	the	narrative	used	to	describe	the	human	dimension	is	not	explicit	enough	 to	be	 captured	by	word	 co-	occurrence	 or	 that	 the	human	dimension	is	not	prevalent	enough	to	be	recognized	as	a	general	topic	or	 specific	 subtopic	 by	 the	 LDA	model.	Additionally	 it	might	 be	 that	 the	 scientific	 production	 on	 the	 human	 dimension	 is	 published	 in	 journals	other	 than	 those	specialized	 in	 fisheries	or	other	 types	of	 outlets	such	as	books	and	book	chapters.	We	could	advance	various	hypotheses	as	to	why	this	might	be	the	case	[e.g.	most	fishery	 scientists	are	biological/natural	sciences	trained	and	oriented	(Link	 2010);	those	who	are	non-	natural	sciences	trained	and	oriented	tend	 to	publish	 in	outlets	 that	 foster	 recognition	 from	within	 their	own	 scientific	communities	such	as	books	rather	than	journals]	but	this	 exercise	would	be	outside	the	scope	of	this	study.	Instead	we	want	 to	emphasize	two	important	recommendations:	(i)	diversification	of	 the	scientific	focus	so	that	it	covers	more	of	the	complexity	of	fisheries	especially	the	human	dimension	(funding	bodies	play	a	crucial	 role	here	by	setting	the	research	agenda)	and	(ii)	publication	of	fisheries	research	in	outlets	more	likely	to	reach	the	intended	audience	 (i.e.	 top	 interdisciplinary	 journals	 or	 specialized	 fisheries	 journals	 if	 the	 objective	 of	 publishing	 is	 to	 contribute	 to	 fisheries	 sustainability	by	reaching	fisheries	policy-	and	decision-	makers).	A	 lack	of	 interdisciplinary	synthesis	in	research	is	one	of	the	major	factors	in	 fisheries	collapses	 (Smith	&	Link	2005).	Thus	more	 integrative	research	and	research	focused	on	the	under-	represented	topics	might	 F IGURE �6?Topical	distribution	over	journals	displayed	as	a	heat	map.	For	each	included	journal	(left)	the	coverage	of	topics	(top)	in	 percentages	is	displayed	(percentage	values	in	cells	row	total	=	100%).	The	heat	map	displays	which	journals	publish	which	topics	and	in	 what	proportions.	See	Table	1	for	journal	year	coverage	as	this	differs	between	journals	(e.g.	1990�2016	1997�2016	2000�16) ?? ? | ?17SYED Et al. provide	 insight	 into	 the	 fine	mechanisms	 of	 fisheries	 as	 a	 SECAS	 and	thus	a	critical	input	for	developing	successful	fisheries	management	approaches.

2020 SANTOS BORIT VANHEE modelling the captains nose.pdf,Chapter 39 Modelling the �Captain�s Nose�: Exploring the Shift Towards Autonomous Fishing with Social Simulation Jorge Santos Melania Borit and Lo�s Vanh�e Abstract With the rapid advances in the development of autonomous vehicles the fishing industry might be faced in the near future with a shift to (partially or fully) autonomous fishing vessels or operations. Large-scale utilization of autonomous fishing practices will lead to a reorganization of society in many respects with critical challenges related to conservation economy governance and ethics. This study focuses on some relevant topics to reflect on with social simulation approaches. These topics will have to be revisited when exploring the possible challenges and opportunities of moving from traditional to autonomous fishing activities. Keywords Fishing industry � Human-agent interaction � Interdisciplinary approaches � Maritime robotics � Multi-agent systems � Social modelling 39.1 Introduction Even though partially or fully autonomous vehicles are present-day technology in several land based or marine transport modes (e.g. [3 5 17 35]) and are also explored as a possibility for maritime operations (e.g. [12 27 28 31]) for various reasons notably cultural [26] the domain of fishing has never been explored until now from this perspective. Fishing can be defined as any activity that involves the catching taking or harvesting of fish [13] and it basically involves the existence of a prey (i.e. the fish) and of an operator (i.e. the fisher) who uses some form of fishing gear. At sea fishing operations are typically supported by specialized vessels. Fishing is the core activity of fisheries which is a concept analysed lately from the J.

Regardless of the challenges of sustainable fisheries management [7] fish is one of the most traded food commodities in the world [10]. By among others increasing human safety providing access to remote or difficult areas (e.g. rough weather spots deep sea) or decreasing costs associated with ship size moving towards autonomous fisheries might be seen as beneficial especially in fisheries targeting valuable species where envisaged profits might just push new technology through the cultural barriers mentioned by [26]. The future of such autonomous fishing (AF) operations can be easily imagined from a technical point of view with multi-agent approaches called in to address the difficulties rising from transforming a classic fishing vessel into a partially or fully AF vessel operating alone or together with supporting marine autonomous vehicles (underwater surface or aerial vehicles) in an AF operation system (AFOS) [37]. However many of the challenges of the transition from traditional fishing to AF stem from the dynamics of social interaction and the fine mechanisms of social processes and thus can be explored using social simulation (SocSim) approaches. Without focusing on a specific type of fisheries we analyse here several classic SocSim topics that we consider immediately relevant. 39.2 Historical Background and a Look into the Future The history of fisheries in the twentieth century shows that technology adoption in this domain was quick but that it took different paths in different ecosystems. For some of the new technologies the fishing industry was not only an early taker but also a strong pressure group for their consolidation (e.g. differential GPS). All the technology build-up (e.g. gradual adoption of radars echosounders sonars GPS) combined with deficient regulations or policies had the downside of the large increase in industrial fishing power [30] with a corresponding dwindling of many important fish stocks. The increased regulation of the last 30 years has led to the decommission of many old vessels (and fishers) which have often been replaced by fewer but larger vessels. This upscaling is also an innovation with comprehensive changes in labour relationships financial organization processing and marketing. It became soon clearer that technology was replacing tradition skill and human intuition (the famous �captain�s nose� [6]): in modern fishing it is not the skipper�s skill and gut feeling but more the size of the boat and experience of the crew that contribute most to fisher�s success [25]. With the advent of autonomous vehicles in many other related areas the fisheries system might be facing a revolution with far reaching environmental and social consequences. Despite social and technological developments fisheries are still and will be very diverse activities owing to the different ecological and geographical settings. The new type of AF will be increasingly embedded with marine aquaculture but also with all other social and economic activities happening at sea and on land with technology augmenting the capacity of humans to deliver niche products. The use of this new technology might lead to setting the ground for a renaissance of clusters along the coasts a vision that 39 Modelling the �Captain�s Nose�: Exploring the Shift Towards. . . 393 is more related to peer-to-peer economy and a decentralized regional territoriality [14] (though the opposite might also happen with stocks being exploited by supranational shing conglomerates). 39.3 Topics to Be Revisited Technological shifts and acceptance of new technology Innovation and acceptance of new technology depend on the cultural context (e.g. kinship) the markets and the value chains under which fishers operate the age of the operators and their long-term commitment to the fishery as well as the regulatory environment [1 22 33]. For thousands of years fisheries were dominated by seasonal activities where traditional knowledge and kin relations in coastal communities played a central role. Early in the industrialization of fisheries by the 1930s fishing operators still possessed a general all round set of skills and knowledge which were passed on within families and communities but they were being embedded in a new technological and institutional complexity. By the year 2000 in the industrial countries and increasingly around the world the main activity of a fisher is to run a business control finances and investments and understand fishing legislation [18]. The fishing knowledge itself is more embedded in technology systems and organizations and the important roles of kin have been replaced by technical education and often imported labour. Technological innovation and adoption goes hand in hand with the development of new processing technology and markets as well as institutional innovation (e.g. cooperatives mutuals or other forms of future governance). There is clearly a pressing need to understand the cultural and social relations that will hinder allow or favour the adoption of new technology and (full) autonomy in the different fisheries and ecosystem settings. SocSim offers a strong approach for evaluating the consequences of this technological transition on societies [23] and previous research in areas such as social norms social influence values/culture trust social psychology reputation and social networks will play an important role here (e.g. [9 24 34]). Moreover serious gaming and participative modelling could facilitate this transition [4]. Resource exploitation In future fisheries production might be more demanddriven (probably for top-quality live fish) and autonomous agents will have to take decisions as to how and when to search for fish (i.e. prey). Once a patch of prey is encountered decisions will have to be made as to how long to stay there before moving on. Predator-prey models have a long history in ecology and have been amply dealt with in individual-based modelling [16]. This includes dealing with the typical patch decision models that play an important role in the optimal foraging theory [8]. Like any other predator automated agents will have to compound the benefits and costs including opportunity costs of staying or leaving a patch as well as of cooperating with other agents in a competitive market economy. Differently from traditional resource exploitation models the agents must deal or learn to deal 394 J. Santos et al. with different types of prey regulations variable order flows information sharing and new governance structures. This socio-techno-ecological complex adaptive system of fisheries constitutes a relevant opportunity for establishing new agentbased models which can be applied for predicting the relevance of combinations of agents policies and institutional structures. Governance AFOSs will include multiple sensors and nearly perfect knowledge of their local environment (e.g. schools of prey). It will be important to match production capacity of a legion of competing AFOSs spread over a large area to the stock size and productivity of the whole prey stock. Owing to the efficiency of autonomous agents as predators the information and (backward) control flows must happen in real time to ensure environmental sustainability. This raises issues about the veracity and asymmetry of the information shared in the network as well as trust and maintenance of trade secrets (commercial advantages) within competing firms. Should networks be controlled by a principal (the government) or multiple principals (agencies) or delegated to trusted agents or to peer-to-peer mechanisms? Application of design thinking to the study and development of optimal governance structures is a relatively recent field and SocSim is a promising approach to experiment and compare these different control regimes [19]. Value chains/network AF will in principle be less constrained by time or weather limitations. This could be suitable for establishment of small supplier firms and for the production and trade of live fish and top quality products. This translates into better welfare for the fish and a superior market for the supplier. In a globalized world there is less competition between individual actors than between value chains. These chains tend to become shorter and demand-driven. The configuration of the chains type of product and markets will dictate whether these chains will be dynamic or stable and this can be explored by SocSim [2]. It is relevant to analyse in which conditions vertical integration marketing and private certification schemes strategic alliances or horizontal arrangements such as cooperatives peerto-peer networking or other hybrid models will be most suitable. Previous SocSim research in areas such as negotiations coordination cooperation reputation social networks or learning will be highly relevant here (e.g. [11 32 36]). Values/morals/ethics Stakeholders and consumers are increasingly conscious of other values than just business or social economics (such as social responsibility animal welfare or valuing nature for its own sake). Simulations on AFOSs supply chains should go further and highlight new dividing issues some of which might have unexpected features. How long should the fish be kept alive after capture and before final consumption to ensure freshness and value but avoid prolonged stress? Should AF only target the highly valued species for the rich consumer markets? What balance of opportunities do we want between large-scale industrial and smallscale community fisheries? Modelling Focusing SocSim efforts on this complex physical social and technological system in transition could contribute to learning how to make better models. From this perspective one key challenge would be eliciting the necessary (and many 39 Modelling the �Captain�s Nose�: Exploring the Shift Towards. . . 395 times implicit) information from the fishers in order to (1) programme the AFOS and its interaction with humans and (2) programme the SocSim models needed to explore the topics mentioned above. Participatory modelling (e.g. [20]) and efforts towards devising methodologies for using qualitative data for informing agent rules (e.g. [15]) would play a crucial role here. 39.4 Conclusion The transition to AF both depends on and is consequential on society as a whole. Thus designing social simulations could be a useful tool for a variety of purposes from making decisions about for example policies or investments to exploring the consequences on society and organizations of the evolution of fishing techniques and fishing activities towards autonomy. Such endeavours might need better social theories and data [29]. Nevertheless they could also contribute to formulating new theories and uncovering undesirable outcomes and promising futures.

Based on this plan national and supranational authorities have developed legislation to fight the so called IUU fishing. A key aspect of the legislation proposed so far is the mandatory recording of some data elements and the requirement that these data should be available for access through a traceability system. This article outlines a general framework for evaluation of these types of requirements using a predictor-outcome N-way matrix. A ��good practise�� system is described against which the existing systems and practises can be evaluated. The framework can be used to assess if the regulatory requirements ensure that the relevant IUU fishing identification data are made available and it can also be used to evaluate the requirements imposed on the traceability system. & 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.1. Introduction 1.1. Background The problem of illegal unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing in world fisheries is considered to be ��of serious and increasing concern�� [1]. Some claim [23] that by the beginning of the 21st century almost 30% of the global fish catch could be counted as IUU in its diverse forms with a total worldwide catch annual value of between 7.5 billion euro and 17.11 billion euro [4]. In the European Union (EU) the IUU fishing imports are estimated to be 10% of the total value of the fish and fish products imports (1.1 billion euro) [5]. Moreover if un-confronted IUU fishing can lead to the non-accomplishment both of management goals and of sustainability of fisheries [6]. Therefore the issue of tackling IUU fishing has received a lot of attention from researchers fisheries managers policy makers non-governmental organisations and fishing industry alike. The ��International plan of action to prevent deter and eliminate IUU fishing�� (IPOA-IUU) [1] was developed by the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) as aAll rights reserved.  response to this increasing problem. This initiative sets out voluntary measures for governments to prevent deter and eliminate IUU fishing. Furthermore it urges states to develop their own National Plans of Actions to fight IUU fishing. An important recommendation in the FAO document is to improve the transparency of the markets in order to allow traceability of fish and fish products to be used as a tool to stop IUU fish from entering the legitimate fish supply chain. Thus traceability a tool or principle which in the food sector is mainly used for documenting properties relating to food safety and quality labelling certification or resource use [7] is in the capture fish industry used to document origin sustainability and legality of catch (non-IUU operation provenance of the fish) [8�10]. Most major seafood exporters/importers such as China Japan and Canada do not impose seafood traceability legal requirements in connection with their fight against IUU fishing but their legislation includes traceability aspects related to safety quality and origin of food in general [11]. In the USA there is now under consideration the adoption of very stringent electronic traceability requirements related to all food imports [12]. However the main driver for these new requirements [1314] is to strengthen the food safety legislation in general and not to address IUU fishing specifically. Following the principles of the IPOA-IUU in 2008 EU adopted new fisheries regulations specially designed to address the IUU M. Borit P. Olsen / Marine Policy 36 (2012) 96�102 97fishing problem: the EU IUU Regulation 1005/2008 [15] and the EU Control Regulation 1224/2009 [16]. Derived from the guidelines of implementation of the IPOA-IUU [17] Regulation 1005/ 2008 ��seeks to ensure full traceability�� [18] ��from fishing net to the plate�� [19] ��of all marine fishery products traded with the Union by means of a catch certification scheme�� [18]. Moreover this Regulation is thought to provide ��improved traceability of fishery products which could be substituted against private traceability systems�� [20]. Regulation 1224/2009 aims ��to back up the traceability system introduced by the IUU Regulation�� [21] by ��introducing a comprehensive traceability system to track all fish and fisheries products throughout the market chain�� [22]. When designing such regulatory requirements a good understanding of both IUU fishing and of the principles of traceability systems is important in order to appropriately follow the recommendations of the IPOA-IUU and of its implementation guide. Therefore the crucial question is: How to evaluate to what degree the existing or proposed regulatory requirements will enable the identification of IUU fish and at the same time be compatible with the traceability systems? This paper provides an answer to this question. Its overall objective is to describe a theoretical framework designed for evaluating regulatory requirements which intend to use traceability in order to prevent deter and eliminate IUU fishing. This is accomplished by deriving the components of a functional and efficient fish and fish products traceability system from the internationally relevant documents and practices from both IUU fishing and traceability of food and food product domains. This results in a ��good practise�� traceability system where all IUU fishing relevant information is always recorded passed on and retrievable. The existing systems and practises can then be evaluated against the ��good practise�� system and shortcomings in the existing systems can thus be identified. The rest of this paper is organised as follows: for a better understanding of the concepts the specialised terms are defined in Section 1.2 while in Section 2 the method used to design the framework is explained with a thorough description of the source documents used in its development. Section 3 presents the results of this method with visualisation of the framework application instructions and general interpretation advice. The significance of the framework together with its strengths weaknesses and limitations is stated in Section 4 while concluding remarks are made in Section 5. 1.2. Definitions 1.2.1. Traceability The most precise definition of product traceability is given by the international standard ISO 8402 (now incorporated in ISO 9000 with wording changed). This states that traceability means ��the ability to trace the history application or location of an entity by means of recorded identifications��. ISO 8402 adds that when applied to products traceability relates specifically to the documentation of ��the origin of materials and parts the product processing history and the distribution and location of the product after delivery��. This means that for traceability of a product to be present recordings related to origin processing and distribution/location must be made. In addition these recordings must be interconnected and made available in such a way that it is possible to trace (or find follow or identify) the history application and location of the product and all its ingredients through the entire supply chain. To achieve this a traceability system is needed.1.2.2. Traceability system The core components of a traceability system are described in various articles [23�25]. In practise a traceability system consists of: The units (products ingredients and components) that are traced often referred to as ��traceable resource units�� or TRUs [23].  An identification or numbering scheme that provides codes or numbers used to uniquely identify TRUs or groups of TRUs.  A method for associating the TRU with the respective code or number. The simplest method of this type is physical printing/ marking directly on the TRU or its container but there are also other methods which are not expanded upon in this article.  Functionality for recording unit properties so that the recordings are linked to the codes and identifiers and through them to the TRUs.  Functionality for getting access to the codes/numbers and the associated recordings typically through a request-response scheme. In practise a traceability system is often implemented using computers software and possibly also automatic data capture but this is not a mandatory requirement and there are numerous examples of well-designed paper-based traceability systems [2627]. It is worth noting that verification and validation of the recorded data are not part of the traceability system. The product properties that one gets access to through a traceability system are not guaranteed to be true or accurate and other mechanisms (for instance inspection certification or use of analytical instruments or methods) are needed to verify or validate the data. 1.2.3. Critical IUU fishing traceability control points (IUU-CTCPs) If the infiltration of IUU fish in the supply chain is seen as a hazard which can be prevented by means of traceability then all the points along the custody chain where the possibility of appearance of the hazard is high can be defined as critical IUU fishing traceability control points (IUU-CTCPs). The fish and fish products can enter a legitimate fish supply chain through three different points: at sea at landing and at onshore distribution chain. This distinction is important as different IUU-CTCPs can be identified at each IUU fish entrance point. 1.2.4. Chain of custody In general ��chain of custody�� refers to the chronological documentation or paper trail showing the seizure custody control transfer analysis and disposition of evidence physical or electronic [28]. However in the fish industry the term ��chain of custody�� has taken on a more specific meaning. Documentation of chain of custody is part of what is required for certification especially certification related to use of eco-labels. The exact chain of custody requirements vary but in two important areas there is in practise a difference between documenting traceability and documenting eco-label type chain of custody:(1) ��Traceability�� is a purely descriptive term and one can split and join (fish) products as much as one likes and still have traceability as long as one documents the fact that the units (for instance the boxes of fish) have been split up or joined together. There are very specific rules for what one is allowed to do in order to maintain the chain of custody as defined by the eco-label certification agencies. A typical rule might be ��you are not allowed to mix together fish from two different suppliers��. In this respect eco-label type chain of custody requirements (��do not mix��) are stricter than the traceability requirements (��mix as much as you like as long as you document it��). M. Borit P. Olsen / Marine Policy 36 (2012) 96�10298(2) Beyond the rules about not mixing eco-label type chain of custody requirements contain no provision for keeping separate units and associated recordings. If the rule is ��you are not allowed to mix together fish from two different suppliers�� there is (from an eco-label type chain of custody view) no difference between two boxes of fish that come from that same certified supplier even if the fish is caught by different vessels or on different days. In a good traceability system this is regarded as essential information and the boxes should have separate unique identifiers and separate sets of properties. In this respect traceability requirements (��if units are physically separated they should be documented separately��) are stricter than the eco-label type chain of custody requirements (��as long as you do not mix in violation of the eco-label rules you do not need to differentiate between units that are of the same category��).It is worth pointing out that this difference between documentation of traceability and documentation of eco-label type chain of custody is largely due to the fact that the ecolabel certification agencies have appropriated the term ��chain of custody�� and assigned a very specific meaning to it. In theory the two terms might mean very much the same thing but in practise in the fish industry there is a difference between traceability and eco-label type chain of custody as outlined above. 1.2.5. Framework A framework is ��a basic conceptual structure�� [29] and the notions ��framework�� and ��conceptual structure�� are often used interchangeably. In this paper the framework is the predictoroutcome N-way matrix [30] where: Each row heading is a descriptor (generic class) � parameter (specific class) pair either for IUU fishing related data that can or should be recorded and made available through the traceability system or for traceability system provisions which may be demanded by the regulatory requirements.  Each column heading indicates the legislative requirements at sea at landing and onshore respectively.  Table 1 Description of the steps to be taken when defining descriptors and parameters for data recording of IUU fishing related information.Each matrix entry indicates whether a legislative requirement exists or not for this data element in the respective part of the supply chain. For further description of the framework see Section 2. # Description of step Example 1 Identify definition/ interpretation/management measure ��It shall be presumed that a fishing vessel was engaged in IUU fishing if it fished without a licence�� or ��Area X is closed for fishing all year round�� 2 Identify the illegal fishing activity ��Fishing without a valid licence�� or ��Fishing at any time in area X�� 3 Describe the identifier Descriptor: ��with or without a valid licence���parameters: ��licence number�� and ��valid to�� or descriptor: ��right or wrong place���parameter: ��area of catch�� 4 Identify other linked IUU fishing components ��What vessel was engaged in this specific IUU fishing activity?�� ��What actors were involved in the IUU fishing activity?�� ��What products were obtained during this IUU fishing activity?�� 5 Describe linked identifiers Descriptor: ��IUU fishing vessel or not���parameters: ��vessel name�� ��vessel flag�� ��vessel call sign�� ��vessel IMO/ Lloyd�s/EU number�� or descriptor: ��bad will vessel owner���parameters: ��registered vessel owner name and address�� ��registered vessel owner nationality��2. Methodology The purpose of the evaluation framework is to assess: (1) if the data recording provisions of the regulatory requirements contain all the relevant information for identifying IUU fishing and (2) if the regulatory requirements establish a functional traceability system. 2.1. Data recording of IUU fishing related information Specific data elements have to be recorded in order to ascertain whether a fishing activity can be classified as IUU fishing. In the evaluation framework these data elements are referred to as ��identifiers�� and they are defined by descriptors (the generic class) and parameters (the specific class). These identifiers are derived from the definition and interpretation of the IUU fishing concepts and from general fisheries management measures. While selecting the identifiers it was considered based on the provisions of FAO IPOA-IUU (e.g. Articles 18 22 48 52�56 74) that the IUU fishing concept has five components: (a) IUUfishing actors (both at national and supranational level: individuals/companies or non-cooperating states) (b) IUU fishing activities (c) IUU fishing vessels (both fishing and support vessels) (d) IUU fish and (e) IUU fishing ports. Thus relevant data for IUU fishing assessment is assigned to the descriptors and parameters according to the process described in Table 1. 2.1.1. Definitions and interpretations The definitions and interpretations given to the IUU fishing concept are the first sources used to determine the identifiers. The basis of their identification is the statements contained in FAO IPOA-IUU. In addition the IUU fishing definition contained in the EU IUU Regulation is also taken into consideration when pointing out the descriptors and parameters. This is done because EU is the biggest market and the leading importer of fisheries products in the world with the value of imported fisheries products (except crustaceans and molluscs) amounting to nearly 20 billion euro in 2006 [31] and the provisions of the EU IUU Regulation have impact on all states which export fish and fish products to EU (around 100 countries [32]). 2.1.1.1. FAO IPOA-IUU. FAO IPOA-IUU contains the commonly accepted and internationally agreed definition of IUU fishing activities. The provisions of its Article 3 indicate in detail the conditions in which fishing has to be conducted in order to be considered IUU. 2.1.1.2. EU IUU Regulation. The IUU fishing activities are described in Article 2 of the EU IUU Regulation exactly in the same manner as in the FAO IPOA-IUU. Moreover in Article 3 (1) the EU legal norm provides clear and extensive means of identification of IUU fishing vessels. For a thorough understanding of the requirements the EU IUU Regulation provisions must be read together with the ones of the EU IUU Implementation Regulation [33]. It is important to note that in contrast with the FAO IPOA-IUU interpretation of IUU fish the EU IUU Regulation treats as IUU fish all the fishery products caught by IUU fishing vessels or originating from non-cooperating third countries not only those specific catches caught during IUU fishing activities (Articles 37 (9) and 38). M. Borit P. Olsen / Marine Policy 36 (2012) 96�102 992.1.2. General fisheries management measures During the last two decades FAO has published several documents which provide advice on general fisheries management measures and these include among others: Code of conduct for responsible fisheries (1995) [34] Fisheries management (1997) [35] Implementation of the IPOA-IUU (2002) [17] and the ecosystem approach to fisheries (2003) [36]. The fisheries management measures proposed by all these documents are the second source used to determinate the identifiers when following the process described in Table 1. When applying the method forTable 2 Description of the steps to be taken when defining identifiers for traceability system related provisions. # Description of step Example 1 Identify definition/ interpretation ��Traceability is the ability to trace the history application or location of an entity by means of recorded identifications�� 2 Identify functional and efficient traceability requirement ��Traceable resource units should be uniquely identified�� 3 Describe the identifier Descriptor: ��unique identification of traceable resource units�� NO NO YES NO At this step do traceability control preventive Is traceability control at this necessary for IUU fish infiltra deterrence?

Decision tree to identify critical IUU fishinevaluating regulatory requirements one also has to use the specific fisheries management measures adopted in the respective setting in order to transform the general descriptor (��area X is closed for fishing all year round��) into an explicit one (��FAO area 27.7.a is closed for fishing all year round��). 2.2. Traceability system related provisions There are some requirements which must be fulfilled by a traceability system in order to be functional and efficient. The method used for identifying these requirements follows the same pattern as in Section 2.1 but this time the identifiers are derived from the definition and interpretation of traceability and related concepts critical IUU fishing traceability control points (IUUCTCPs) and chain of custody. The data necessary to specify a functional and efficient traceability system are thus clustered around descriptors and parameters as described in Table 2.2.2.1. Critical IUU fishing traceability control points (IUU-CTCPs) In order to identify the IUU-CTCPs this paper proposes the steps suggested in Fig. 1. These steps were designed following the decision tree modelling method [30] and Principle 2 of Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points [37]. In this context the step measures exist?

TRACEABILITY CONTROL POINT TCP. g traceability points in the fish supply chain. M. Borit P. Olsen / Marine Policy 36 (2012) 96�102100is defined as an operation (e.g. harvesting landing) or transformation (e.g. splitting joining and grouping) in the fish supply chain from primary production to final consumption the point in the chain where the possibility for mixing non-IUU fish and IUU fish exists. Each of the points identified will need traceability controls to ensure that mixing does not occur. Among the IUU-CTCPs identified according to this method there are for example: (1) at sea: fishing harvesting or transhipment operations; (2) at landing: pumping fish from the fishing vessel into basins; (3) at onshore distribution chain: packing crates with fish brought by different fishing vessels or even fish from the same vessel but from different catches. The identification of IUU-CTCPs along the fish supply chain is important as it indicates the weakest links of the supply chain the points where the entrance of IUU fish in the legitimate trade could be stopped or reduced by means of traceability. 2.2.2. Categories of traceability Traceability can be distinguished into two interrelated categories: internal and external. The last category is more commonly referred to as chain traceability. Internal traceability refers to the ability to keep track of what happens to a product its ingredients and packaging within a company or production facility. For example when a company receives a box of mackerel and uses the fish to produce flavoured smoked mackerel it should keep records from whom the fish was received if the fish was mixed with other received raw material what smoking process was used and what temperatures what ingredients were used and where did they come from where the finished product packing came from and where the finished product goes. Chain traceability refers to the ability to keep track of what happens to a product its ingredients and packaging in the entire or part of a supply chain across companies and individual facilities. For example if a customer in a supermarket wants to know if the purchased fish was caught by trawl or long line it should be possible to find this information with a chain traceability system. 2.2.3. Traceable resource units (TRUs) The concept of TRU is a key aspect in traceability. A TRU must be uniquely identifiable and linked to the relevant records in order to be followed along the supply chain: it can be one fish (e.g. one tuna) one box of fish one catch one day�s catch or one week�s catch. It has been the prerogative of the industry to define the appropriate unit [38]. Typically the fish industry will refer to batches logistic units and trade units. Batches are linked to catch or production and all the fish that are part of the batch will have been caught or produced in the same way at roughly the same time. Trade units are the smallest identified units that pass between the companies (or the processes). After landing and processing the trade unit is typically a box of fish. Logistic units are trade units grouped together for transport or storage typically pallets or containers. In general only the trade unit will keep its integrity (i.e. remain unopened) from source to destination. Logistic units will often be opened underway and the contents split up or joined together to meet customer orders where as production batches in general are not kept together as one single unit. For this reason it is necessary to use the trade units as TRUs if systematic information loss is to be avoided. Note also that batches relate to internal traceability while trade units and logistic units relate to chain traceability. This distinction is important because in a ��good practise�� system globally unique identifiers will be given to TRUs involved in chain traceability and since a production batch is an internal matter it does not need to have a globally unique identifier (but of course it should be assigned a unique internal number).2.2.4. Operations/transformations and mass balance At each point of the supply chain the TRUs go through different types of operations/transformations (transfer addition etc.). In order to achieve efficient traceability of the product the information that is linked to that product must undergo a parallel operation so the product and the information will remain linked. There are six main types of operations/transformations related to TRUs and their linked data [3940]. Some of them are more exposed and susceptible to infiltration of IUU fishery products or can facilitate it as for example the transfer the joining or the splitting of traceable units. To be able to trace both backwards to find the origin of the product and forward to find where the product went it is vital to record all transformations the lowest TRU is subject to and such recording procedures have been previously described [41]. Mass balance accounting is a very important aspect in a fish traceability system as it prevents the infiltration of fish from untraceable provenance usually from IUU fishing activities during the operations/transformations the non-IUU fish undergoes. The fish net weight delivered should be less or equal to the fish net weight received and the mass balance has always to be calculated and recorded. For example a tuna canning factory receives five tonnes of uniquely identified tuna fish crates but delivers cans that contain in total seven tonnes of net weight of tuna fish. The question that arises is where do the additional two tonnes of tuna fish come from? If no recorded evidence can be found according to applicable legal provisions in order to identify the provenance of the two extra tonnes of tuna (no unique identification codes no catch certificates etc.) then it is clear that the fish is likely to have an IUU fishing origin. The same accountability process can be applied at national level for example when checking the internal trade and exports of fish and fish products against the internal catches and imports. 2.2.5. Chain of custody assurance The differences between traceability and eco-label chain of custody were explained in Section 1.2. The evaluation framework adapts eco-label type chain of custody requirements (which are available in a more or less standardised form) in order to use them as a source for identifying descriptors and parameters for the traceability related data. To summarise the main ideas of Sections 2.2.1�2.2.5 there are five key elements of a functional and efficient fish and fish products traceability system (a ��good practise�� system): (1) data recording of unique identification codes starts from the smallest TRU (preferably the trade unit); (2) mass balance of TRUs is always calculated; (3) all transformations/operations the TRU undergoes are always recorded; (4) the properties of the TRUs are always recorded; (5) special measures are in place at each link of the supply chain in order to assure the chain of custody of the TRUs.3. Results The visual layout of the assessment framework is displayed in Table 3. Anyone who wants to use the framework in order to evaluate if the existent or proposed regulatory requirements fulfil both the needs of IUU fishing deterrence and of traceability systems has to observe the following steps:(1) Identify the IUU-CTCPs for the specific fish supply chain and introduce them into the matrix.(2) Identify the IUU-CTCPs covered by the regulatory requirements under assessment and introduce them into the matrix with their respective article number. If an IUU-CTCP is similar to the one identified at step (1) only the second entry should be made. Table 3 Simplified version of the predictor-outcome N-way matrix for evaluation of regulatory requirements which intend to use traceability in order to prevent deter and eliminate IUU fishing. The rating system used when filling in the matrix is: ��x�� for existence ��/�� for non-existence and ��N/A�� if the entry is not applicable at the specific point of analysis. For example if the mass balance requirement is existent in the provision about declarations filled in at the point of first sale the box relative to the mass balance descriptor will be rated with ��x��. Accordingly if the same mass balance requirement does not exist in the provision about declarations filled when delivering the products to transporter the same box will be rated with ��/��.

Borit P. Olsen / Marine Policy 36 (2012) 96�102 101(3) Go thoroughly through the regulatory requirements and the matrix at the same time and make the necessary ratings. When filling in the matrix one should take into consideration the specific but not the general provisions of the regulatory requirements. For example if the requirement reads: ��all fish products shall be traceable from catch to final consumer�� this provision cannot in itself be analysed but the specific ones which refer to concrete measures taken to enable the traceability of fish products can be.(4) Conclude if the respective regulatory requirements cover all the IUU-CTCPs by cross-checking the entries under steps (1) and (2).(5) Assess whether the requirements capture all the relevant data for IUU fishing deterrence by checking the entries under rows I. It may happen that not all the data is captured by the regulatory requirements and in this case it has to be interpreted in what degree the recorded data is helpful in IUU fishing deterrence.(6) Assess if the traceability system principles were used in a functional and efficient way by checking the entries under rows II and III. In the presence of such a traceability system all boxes under these rows have to be rated ��x��. If not all them have this rating it has to be interpreted in what degree the regulatory requirements really impose a traceability system.The framework and the method described above have been used to evaluate the provisions of the EU IUU Regulation the EU IUU Implementation Regulation and of the EU Control Regulation but the details and conclusions of the respective evaluations are beyond the scope of this paper [42].4. Discussion This framework can be used to evaluate if the respective regulatory requirements fulfil both the specifications of a traceability system and of an IUU fishing deterrence scheme. Hence it is useful for policy makers at any management level for analysing the content of regulatory requirements under both de lege lata and de lege ferenda approach. Together with the process mapping method for analysing material flow information flow and information loss in food supplychains [43] and the ex ante cost-benefit analysis method of investing in a traceability system [44] the framework detailed here can be considered one of the tools available to policy makers in assessing the efficiency and functionality of a certain traceability system required in the fish supply chain. It is important to have such an assessment methodology at hand as there is now a tendency in the fisheries management sector to try to use traceability as a tool in order to prevent deter and eliminate IUU fishing. However as any other tool traceability has to be properly used in order to achieve its intended goals. The rating system being straightforward as existence and nonexistence are not matters of interpretation but of strict identification the framework is replicable for any regulatory requirements. The comprehensive display and the multitude of inferences that can be made are probably the strongest assets of the developed methodology. Nevertheless at some point their width and depth could also be the weakest point as the multipleentry format may seem intricate to some. However being a threefold assessment (IUU fishing traceability and regulatory provisions) the chosen display seems to be appropriate as it enables the integration of all the data in a readable and predictable manner. The framework is constructed to be generic flexible and extensible and should be easy to apply at different regulatory levels and to different fishery specific cases.5. Conclusions It is believed at the international level that traceability can be used in fish supply chains not only for quality and safety assurance but also for IUU fishing deterrence. Therefore fisheries managers around the world from different regulatory levels (individual company state or supra-state) are trying to use traceability as a tool in their endeavour to stop pirate fishing. At the same time NGOs academics industry and consumers alike are trying to decide if the existent regulatory requirements satisfy their intended goal. The framework proposed here offers all these actors an instrument with an important function: assessment of existent or proposed regulatory requirements from a double stand-point � IUU fishing identification and traceability. However M. Borit P. Olsen / Marine Policy 36 (2012) 96�102102interdisciplinary approaches are always more difficult than disciplinary ones. Therefore a good understanding of the IUU fishing on one side and of traceability principles on the other side is necessary. The proposed framework bases itself on a thorough interpretation of the involved concepts and offers policy makers from any regulatory level a robust tool in correctly tackling IUU fishing from a traceability perspective.Acknowledgements The first author sincerely thanks Michaela Aschan Jorge Santos and Cornel Borit for their useful comments.

2022 SZCZEPANSKA ANGOURAKIS GRAHAM BORIT Quantum Leaper A Methodology Journey.pdf,Quantum Leaper: A Methodology Journey From a Model in NetLogo to a Game in Unity Timo Szczepanska  Andreas Angourakis  Shawn Graham  and Melania Borit Abstract Combining Games and Agent-BasedModels (ABMs) in a single research design (i.e. GAM design) shows potential for investigating complex past present or future social phenomena. Games offer engaging environments that can help generating insights into social dynamics perceptions and behaviours while ABMs support the representation and analysis of complexity. We present here the first attempt to �discipline� the interdisciplinary endeavour of developing a GAM design in which an ABM is transformed into a game thus the two becoming intertwined in one application.When doing this we use as aGAMdesign exemplar the process of developing Quantum Leaper a proof-of-concept video game made in Unity software and based on the NetLogo implementation of the well known �Artificial Anasazi� ABM. This study aims to consolidate themethodology component of theGAMfield by proposing the GAMReflection Framework a tool that can be used byGAMpractitioners ABM modellers or game designers looking for methodological guidance with developing an agent-based model that is a game (i.e. an agent-based game).

Games offer engaging environments to generate insights into social dynamics perceptions and behaviours while ABMs support complexity analysis. The GAMfield is relatively new and only a fewmethodological descriptions are available for those who want to venture into it. A recent Systematic Literature Review of the GAM field [15] provides a general description of six research designs to combine Games and ABMs. The designs are organised in two groups: (1) sequential combinations over time either from a Game to an ABM or from an ABM to a Game and (2) simultaneous combinations where either the ABM provides support to the Game (e.g. to calculate the effect of player actions on their environment) or the ABM and the Game are merged into one integrated application. There is no systematic method description of how to implement this latter design (i.e. GAM type 6 ABM = GAME) which leads to practitioners and newcomers in this field still to largely rely on intuition and on ad hoc solutions (own creations or imitations). This study contributes to filling up this gap and proposes a way to �discipline� the process of transforming an ABM into a Game (i.e. an agent-based game). This study can be used byGAMpractitioners whowant to increase the learning value of their practices as well as the rigour and transparency of these. Coordinators of research using GAM designs ABM modellers or game designers can use this study as guidance to structure the collaborative work in interdisciplinary teams that use these designs. This study uses Quantum Leaper (QL) as an exemplar of GAM type 6 ABM = GAME. QL is a proof-of-concept video game made in Unity and based on the NetLogo implementation of the known �Artificial Anasazi� (AA) ABM. Here we present an overview of the QL development highlighting the main design steps. Starting from these steps we propose a high-level reflection framework that integrates conceptual thinking from interdisciplinarity ABM development and game design i.e. the GAM Reflection Framework. To capture the journey of making this framework we used a storytelling approach to structure the remainder of this paper in a conclusive narrative. 2 The Settings: The Backdrop and Environment for the Story The setting is the time and the location in which a story takes place. This setting can be very specific but can also be more broad. In the case of our story the setting was a foggy place. We reviewed the literature for general methodological advice about how to develop a GAM design of type 6 ABM = GAME but were not able to find such descriptions. However we found several individual examples of GAM studies (e.g. [7 11]). In order to be able to orientate ourselves through the fog we decided to use an exemplar of GAM study as our focal point and selected the Quantum Leaper video game for this role (more details about how this decision was taken are given in Sect. 3). From there on we looked into studies similar to QL but found only projects Quantum Leaper: A Methodology Journey From a Model in NetLogo � 193 where a 3D game interface was used to visualise and query the output of ABMs depicting historical populations (e.g. [3 16]). After coming to this understanding the nature of the settings of our story came clearly in sight: we were exploring an uncharted domain but we had a starting point. 3 The Characters: Their Role and Purpose A story usually includes a number of characters each with a different role and purpose and there is almost always a protagonist and an antagonist or obstacle to overcome. In our story there were four protagonists each with their unique set of tools. Some of these tools can be seen as characters on their own right having the role of deuteragonist i.e. the constant companion to the protagonist during the journey. The interest in agent-based modelling and games was a common characteristic of the four protagonists. Otherwise two of these were digital archaeologists and the other two were active in the natural resource management field. The latter were on a quest of disentangling the methodological intricacies of using games and ABMs as a research device for sustainable resource management when they came across the Quantum Leaper. Interested in connecting with the social simulation community the QL designers joined the quest. While the antagonist in this story is the difficulty of the disentangling process the constant companions to the protagonists during their journey were the QL and the �Artificial Anasazi� ABM. QL was used as an (almost) ideal specimen of GAM design type 6 (i.e. an exemplar) as it clearly displayed an agent-based game: anABM a game and the interconnection between the two. The possibility of directly working with its designers had the potential of making explicit the implicit decision-making processes of creating this agent-based game. Quantum Leaper. QL a side-project of two of the co-authors of this study was initiated in 2017 and it was conceptualised as an experiment to embed ABMs into immersive video games particularly considering the potential of such integrated approach for archaeology. It aimed to demonstrate that �playing� ABMs immersively can reveal new insights about both themodel and the system represented. Even though unfinished QL was presented publicly on several occasions [2] raising the interest of a wide and diverse public ranging from archaeologists to game designers. QL is based on the NetLogo implementation of the known �Artificial Anasazi� ABM. For more details see the part of the development files in [1] and Chap.5 in [6]. The �Artificial Anasazi� (AA) ABM. AA received great attention because of its implications for the socio-ecological resilience in front of climate change. It represents the population dynamics in the Long House Valley in Arizona (USA) between 800 and 1350 AD [4]. Archaeological data shows that the valley was abandoned towards the end of this period and the main hypothesis put forward pointed to climate change as the main cause. To address this and other hypotheses the model relates a population of households with a simplified maize-based food economy dependent on soil types and changing humidity conditions. Simulations are evalu194 T. Szczepanska et al. ated in reference to the historical estimations of population size and distribution per year. The original authors interpreted the results as indicative that climate change alone was not sufficient to explain the abandonment of the valley. Themodel was first implemented in Ascape which is now virtually inaccessible but was later implemented in NetLogo [19] and published in two quasi-equivalent versions: Janssen�s [9 10] and NetLogo Model Library�s [14]. 4 The Journey: The Travel From an ABM to a Game The QL project was organised into three work packages whose tasks intertwined: (A) ABM replication adaptation and extension (B) Game conceptual design and (C) Game development. A. ABM replication adaptation and extension Both versions of AA (implemented in NetLogo 5.3.1) were reviewed and translated to C# the primary language used for scripting in Unity a popular cross-platform game engine. The alternative of running NetLogo from a C# script in Unity was considered but discarded due to its technical complexity and potential licensing issues (i.e. releasing a copy of NetLogo together with the game). Bringing AA to C# and Unity involved these tasks. A1. Creation of a C# library for ABM. C# is a general-purpose object-oriented language (i.e. not specialised in ABMs). It has little resemblance to NetLogo�s syntax lackingmost of its keyprimitives (e.g. theask command). Thus thefirst and necessary step in translating themodel was the creation of a C# library implementing those NetLogo built-in features used in AA. A2. Code revision and modification in NetLogo. Code reviewing was guided and complemented with related publications scattered over the last thirty years including the work done more recently in expanding the original model. By studying the model in detail and translating the NetLogo code line-by-line the QL development team soon encountered a few issues that had to be addressed before moving to C#. These included the following. Spatial input data. The files accompanying both NetLogo implementations (e.g. water.txt settlements.txt) included impossible coordinates for a few �water points� and historical settlements. Given that this issue has a minimal impact on aggregate behaviour and the original raw data is hardly traceable it was decided to exclude these data entries. Scheduling and data time-series. The model scheduling was found to be shifted in respect to the palaeoenvironmental time-series data (e.g. adjustedPDSI.txt environment.txt water.txt) which regulate agricultural productivity in each year/location in the model. For instance the data corresponding to the first year (800 AD) is used twice during the setup and go procedures. The issue was solved by counting setup as the first year and updating the year counter at the start of time steps rather than at the end.

Simulations under two random seeds 0 and 123 are given as examples Inheritance of maize stock. In both NetLogo versions the inheritance of maize stock happening during household fission was not functioning as the modellers (presumably) intended. When �fissioning� the parent household discounts a certain amount of stock as determined by a parameter (maize-gift-to-child in NetLogo library�s version). However the child household receives a different amount completely unrelated to the parent�s stock. This was corrected by stating a perfect equivalence between the amounts discounted in the parent�s stock and received by the child�s. After these corrections were made still within NetLogo AA produced system trajectories that were already quite different from the originals (Fig. 1). A3. Model adaptation and extension. After reviewing the code and consolidating the game concept (i.e. immersive first-person see Sect. 4) it became clear that the original model had to be further modified. These corrections and modifications made the simulation runs to displaymore path-dependent trajectories as the success of new householdswas closely related to the previous success of the parent household. These are the most important changes. Break up household population into individual members. Households are the atomic units of the AA model. These were modelled as if they were asexual organisms that are born out of a parent organism give birth to other child organisms and eventually die of starvation or old age. A household fitness at any given year depends on its stock of food (cultivatedmaize) the consumption rate per person-year and the number of people inside. Under this design the population of a household e.g. five people will appear from thin air in a given year (a household is born) generate new fully-populated households under certain conditions (household fission) and then disappear after a certain number of years (household death). However this conceptualisation was considered an obstacle for designing an immersive game in first-person perspective. The solution was to expand the model by adding a �character� or �person� dimension within households. These characters are not 196 T. Szczepanska et al. proper agents; they are accounted in array variables inside each household agent (e.g. age = 34 25 7 5 1 indicate the ages of the five individual members in a household). Characters are the ones being born having children and eventually dying while a household will only �die� if there are no characters inside. On game development this modification was combinedwith a controlled random number generator to allow believable characters (with name age sex lineage etc.) to be tracked in time and space. Convert constants and parameters. Several household parameters were re-interpreted as parametric or emergent distributions of household members variables. For instance the consumption of maize per capita previously applied to all households as a global parameter became a set of parameters defining a probability distribution from which to draw values for each individual. The QL version of the model is consequently more stochastic has fewer global parameters and is less affected by specific parameter settings. B. Game conceptual design The main game concept is inspired by the NBC science-fiction television series Quantum leap (1989�1993). Thus the player is an archaeologist from the future involved in an experimental technique that allows consciousness to time-travel. An accident happens and the player�s consciousness travels to the past involuntarily replacing the consciousness of a person that lived in the Ancestral Puebloan culture formally called Anasazi in the Long House Valley (Arizona USA) between 800 and 1350 AD. When this happens the course of history changes. In order to come back to the present (i.e. finish the game) the player has the task to match the games� course to the historical development (increasing a convergence score). This can be done by incarnating in individuals immersing into their biographies and influencing the behaviour of immediate peers through dialogue and social interaction. This combination of context and mechanics was considered the best solution for making the agent-level perspective compatible with immersive gameplay given the centuries-long scale of simulations. The game flow is represented in Fig. 2. C. Game development Fig. 2 Quantum Leaper game flow Quantum Leaper: A Methodology Journey From a Model in NetLogo � 197 Fig. 3 Prototype in-game screenshots of the Incarnation scene The Unity game engine was chosen for the implementation of the game as it is relatively straightforward to learn progressively allowing for fast development while containing the potential for complexity both in terms of code and aesthetics (Fig. 3). These were the major QL development tasks. In-game management of simulation data. To connect simulations with gameplay effectively one of the first tasks was to program a system to serialise and deserialise simulation data effectively. During gameplay the systemwill create binary files each containing the state of the simulation at the end of a time step (i.e. year). These files are re-written every time the simulation is run from an earlier year. Simulation data is deserialised when entering the Incarnation scene and used to generate or configure game objects (e.g. age affects characters� height). Loading and decorating the 3D landscape. Because AA is placed in a real location (Longhouse Valley USA) the development team aimed at using real-world spatial data to configure the 3D space experienced during character incarnation.However this presented three sets of challenges: (i) finding a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) with a good-enough resolution importing it to Unity and making it realistic when experienced from the first-person perspective; (ii) applying terrain textures and adding the scenery (natural environment buildings and characters) through procedural generation; and (iii) loading and deleting terrain chunks seamlessly around the moving player which is required given the large size of the entire valley area. After overcoming these challenges a set of Unity-C# assets were developed and released [1]. Dialogue system. An interactive narrative system using Twine-Tracery (the grammar-expansion library Twine combinedwith the interactive fiction tool Tracery) was employed to mediate between player and non-player characters. The player�s decisions regarding dialogue options feed information back to the simulation by modifying certain variables (e.g. convincing characters to eat less will decrease the consumption of maize of those individuals). Artistic assets. Audiovisual elements (e.g. 3D models textures text sound effects) in games are critical for player immersion. In QL the development team used Unity�s own sponsored community (Unity Asset Store) which includes several basic free assets that can be used for learning and prototyping. User interface (UI) and game system. AminimalUI and game systemwere created for QL using the resources found in Unity Asset Store including a splash and start 198 T. Szczepanska et al. screen options and game start menus a loading screen player controllers and a HUD (heads-up display) showing the current year and convergence percentage in the top-right corner of the screen. QL has been developed as a side project and remains as an unfinished and unpublished prototype. This project still lacks a functional system and text base to handle dialogues which is the primary action during gameplay and a key factor for immersion. Additionally to reach QL�s full potential artistic assets should be curated by experts about the Ancestral Puebloans (e.g. anthropologists archaeologists native community representatives). 5 The Conflict Resolution: Where the Protagonist Finally Overcomes the Conflict Learns to Accept It or Is Ultimately Defeated by It At the resolution point usually the story ends. The protagonist fulfills the initial goal does not fulfill it or transforms it. In our case after a close analysis of the journey we propose the GAMReflection Framework and invite the reader to discuss its usefulness. How to describe in a meaningful way the integration of an ABM with a Game? Answering this question was not an easy nut to crack. As a first contribution to this answer we propose a reflection framework. As explained by Rapoport �[�] frameworks are neither models nor theories. Models describe how things work whereas theories explain phenomena. Frameworks do neither; rather they help to think about phenomena to order material revealing patterns�� [13] (page 256). After closely examining the development of QL especially the last sentence sounded appealing to us: as a first step in the GAM method we think that one has to go through a structured reflection about what is being combined how and why. Reflection is considered the key learning activity to transform concrete experience into abstract concepts to generalize main ideas and principles [12]. Moreover reflection is a process that utilizes knowledge that �lies deep within (tacit knowledge)�so deep it is often taken for granted and not explicitly acknowledged but it is the data humans use to make instinctive decisions based upon accumulated knowledge from past actions and experience� [8](page 22). As such it seems to us of crucial importance to have useful tools that guide this process especially in a tangled process such as using GAM designs. The process of combining ABMs and games in a GAM design can be understood as a process of interdisciplinary research in the sense that it involves disciplines with contrasting paradigms forcing researchers to cross subject boundaries in order to create new knowledge theory and/or methods and solve a common research goal [17]. As such the GAM Reflection Framework is an adaptation of the protocol for assessing the interdisciplinarity of models proposed by [18] which maximises the extraction of implicit knowledge and decisions. However proposing tools seems Quantum Leaper: A Methodology Journey From a Model in NetLogo � 199 Table 1 The GAM reflection framework (Part 1) applied to the case of Quantum Leaper PART 1 Formal reflections WHAT contributes to GAM What disciplines and knowledge bodies were involved and integrated?

Thus in order to give a taste of its applicability and encourage its use we provide a demonstration on the QL case which out of space consideration is included directly in the framework (Tables1 and 2). The core assumptions of theGAMReflection Framework are: (1) that the analysed application includes an ABM (pre-existing or developed from scratch); (2) that the analysed application includes a Game with all the necessary elements of a game (e.g. mechanics dynamics aesthetics); (3) that both the ABM and the Game co200 T. Szczepanska et al. Table 2 The GAM reflection framework (Part 2) applied to the case of Quantum Leaper PART 2 General reflections Team (organisation communication etc.) QL was developed by a two-person team working mostly side-by-side on different tasks. It was noticeable that the team lacked some key skills particularly those of a trained artist and writer. Most work was done in Unity and at the time (2017) sharing Unity projects in an orderly way was more challenging than today. Unity now offers a built-in cloud service with version control through which collaborators can work on the same project. Game engines or platforms (pros and cons challenges etc.) Unity is surely one of the most comprehensive and accessible game engines available at present. The QL prototype was developed relatively fast thanks to this and given the vast online community of users sharing Unity assets including C# code snippets. However it is a tool in constant change and improvement making learning new features a never-ending necessity. Engaging with some kind of formal learning (e.g. MOOCs) recommendable to make the most of it. Transparency and rigour (measures taken etc.) The team kept an ongoing design document were notes about advancements and new ideas were stored and shared. The code base of the ABM and game system has been constantly tested refactored and annotated aiming at making it reproducible and readable for a wider public. Screen video recordings were made after different milestones in development and shared on YouTube. Stakeholders (interaction etc.) (Pending until after the game is published) Outputs/outcomes (what was produced how it was received etc.) (Pending until after the game is published) exists and are integrated in one single application; thus they run simultaneously; (4) that the GAM design has a research purpose. The GAM Reflection Framework is divided in two parts: reflections structured around the interdisciplinarity of the endeavour (Part 1 Formal reflections; Table1) and reflections structured around the general process of building the agent-based game (Part 2 General reflections; Table2). While reflection are usually undertaken at the end of a task or activity we encourage the possible users to use this framework before during and/or after the GAM design process is finished. We base this recommendation on findings from research on learning which explain that in order to make reflection useful for development of cognitive levels and not only of the affective levels reflection should be implemented in a well-structured intentional manner with purposeful fidelity throughout the course of activities [5]. We envisage four types of users of the GAM Reflection Framework: GAM practitioners coordinators of research that includes GAM designs ABMmodellers and game designers. GAM practitioners can use the framework to increase the value of learning from their own practices in addition to increasing the rigour and transparency of these practices. Using the framework can also help these users to express Quantum Leaper: A Methodology Journey From a Model in NetLogo � 201 clearly the interdisciplinary characteristics of their agent-based game. Coordinators of research that includes GAM designs can use the tool to plan the research tasks while ABMmodellers and game designers can use it as guidance to structure the collaborative work in interdisciplinary teams that use these designs or to assess whether such work is something that they want to add to their portfolio. 6 Conclusion Building on experience with interdisciplinary research on insights from using reflection as a learning tool and the description of the steps taken to transform theNetLogo ABM �Artificial Anasazi� into a Unity-based immersive first-person video game Quantum Leaper this paper attempts to �discipline� or bring some methodological organisation in the field of combiningABMandGames. As such this study provides a framework for reflections during the process of combining these two. We aim at contributing to the discussion and consolidation of methodological principles that are generally applicable to research using GAM the GAM Reflection Framework. We present a brief demonstration of this framework by examining the Quantum Leaper video game. This framework is intended as a tool that can be combined with other approaches and frameworks contributing to the GAM field development. The framework is a potentially learning-rich tool for GAM practitioners coordinators of GAM designs-based research ABM modellers and game designers alike.

Autonomous Fishing Vessels Roving the Seas: What Multiagent Systems Have Got to Do with It. In Proc. of the 17th International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (AAMAS 2018) Stockholm Sweden July 10�15 2018 IFAAMAS 5 pages. 1 INTRODUCTION Partial or total autonomy is explored as a possibility for maritime operations in domains such as military activities [11] maritime and port security [31] maritime transport / shipping [4] oil and gas exploitation [34] offshore renewable energy [18] marine /coastal monitoring [27] and aquaculture [28]. Following this trend this study focuses on fishing a maritime operations domain that has never been explored before from this perspective. Fishing is defined as any activity that involves the catching taking or harvesting of fish [12] and as such is the core activity of fisheries a concept analysed lately through the lenses of socioecological complex adaptive systems [17]. In many respects fishing has not evolved from the primitive forms of hunting but it is a diversified activity. It relies on the existence of a prey (i.e. the fish) and an operator (i.e. fisher) equipped with some form of fishing gear. Presently fish is one of the most traded food commodities in a world basis despite wild fish being a limited resource [10]. Where fisheries target valuable species or in industrial fisheries automation may be beneficial: a) it can provide access to otherwise ?Corresponding author Proc. of the 17th International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (AAMAS 2018) M.

When crossing the domain of fishingwith the one of autonomous vehicles the main research questions rise around transforming a classic fishing vessel into a partial or full autonomous fishing vessel (AFV) operating alone or in an autonomous fishing operation system (FOS) i.e. together with supporting marine autonomous vehicles be they underwater or surface vehicles and possibly aerial autonomous vehicles. Besides clearly attainable benefits due to the technical and social complexity of fishing operations which go beyond those raised by other domains where autonomous vehicles are used (e.g. navigate find catch store and transport live animals for human consumption with minimum economic environmental and animal welfare costs; presence of self-interested operators the need to prevent illegalities the need of cooperation between operators) the autonomous fishing may bring unparalleled changes to the fishing industry (i.e. paradigm shift in the ways the fish are caught processed and maintained to the market stage) as well as raise critical challenges related to technology safety conservation law and ethics. Some of these challenges could be addressed using multiagent approaches. Here we analyse these possibilities together with the associated difficulties. 2 FISHING OPERATIONS AND FISHING VESSELS A fishing operation is composed of four phases: search/detection capture storage and transport/carry of fish. The capture phase can be performed with fishing vessels or without them (e.g. fishing Session 29: Blue Sky AAMAS 2018 July 10-15 2018 Stockholm Sweden 1193 with traps or trap nets) and this phase can be active (e.g. with trawls) or passive (e.g. with gillnets) [32]. A fishing vessel is an odd combination of functions: transport (i.e. navigation movement) carrier hospitality (i.e. hosting people on board) and a dedicated fishing function [26]. Often these vessels are built specially for one type of industrial fishing (e.g. tuna fishing) having special equipment (e.g. seines) whose deployment requires very special skills from the crew. As some experienced people put it there are critical aspects and instants that only a human captain on-board can handle on this kind of vessels (as they are operated today) [35]. These events are related to the critical time to deploy the gear which can be a costly operation without jeopardizing the safety of the crew and vessel while respecting the navigational and fishery regulations. An array of sensors are commercial available to aid with navigation fish search and with the environmental and catch variables of the fishing gear. 3 LOOKING INTO THE FUTURE Autonomous fish capturing: vessels and passive gear: For the purpose of demonstrating the core vision about autonomous fishing we present here possible developments in the phases of search/detection and capture and for full autonomy a model that would maximise all the benefits enumerated in Section 1. In addition to AFVs autonomous fishing could also be implemented via autonomous passive fishing gear (APFG) i.e. traps and nets or a combination of both AFV and APFG. Passive fishing gear is utilized since ancient times and it has interesting characteristics such as low cost of operation and the possibility to keep the fish alive for long periods of time. Their operation is generally devoid of the critical events frequent in operation of active gear and as such they would be the first candidates to autonomization of fishing. In the case of APFG the autonomous vehicle component would be related to the movement of the gear to appropriate places (horizontally or vertically) and transport of fish holding structures. Repetitive low-intensity operations by autonomous passive fishing gear increase the time and opportunity to expose live fish to non-lethal sorting procedures (based on size behaviour etc.) decreasing bycatch. At the same time these vehicles could collect and transmit information related to environment (e.g. depth temperature light) navigation and hazards as well as size and type of catch. Autonomous fishing operation systems: An autonomous fishing operation system (AFOS) can be defined as the multiple interacting autonomous agents (AA) that perform tasks necessary for integrated fishing operations (Figure 1). An integrated fishing operation would link or coordinate the four phases of a fishing operation: search/detection capture storage and transport/carry; in this study we focus only on the first two of these phases. In addition to the AFVs or APFGs a variety of supporting autonomous marine vehicles and even autonomous aerial vehicles could be deployed in such a system. These vehicles could be seen operating as multiagent systems (MASs). As far as we can predict now AFOS would have to make use of MASs techniques because the application domain is intrinsically decentralised. Agents are on different vehicles which are difficult to connect (e.g. one is on the surface one is underwater; there is no global Internet far away from shore or in harsh environments such as strong winds high waves extreme cold; there is Figure 1: Example of anAutonomous FishingOperation System (AFOS) performing search/detection and capture phases of a fishing operation. Usually either a) or b) would perform the fish capturing task with c) and d) as support vehicles. a) Autonomous Fishing Vessel (coordinating with c) and d) for optimal path planning); b) Autonomous Passive Fishing Gear (trap-net capturing fish); c) Autonomous Surface Vehicle (collecting data about the environment e.g. light temperature concentration of zooplankton and communicating it to a) and/or b)); d) Autonomous Aerial Vehicle (coordinating with c) in order to reduce by-catch and with a) for optimal path planning). need for robustness if the Internet connectivity is lost; there is a need for reactivity that prevents to use internet). The specificity of fishing operations requires that each agent acts in autonomy while taking others into consideration even in the absence of centralized decision-making. Further complexity is added by the fact that that agents might represent different stakeholders (e.g. various fishing companies) thus multiple agents are required to defend multiple private interests (e.g. fishing performed by different companies employing AFOSs in the same area) while stakeholders might have private information they do not want to share with others (e.g. exact location of targeted fish). Underwater vehicles: Such vehicles could be deployed for water sampling bathymetric surveys reduction of bycatch . Surface vehicles: These vehicles could range from drifting or fixed buoys to hydrodynamic moving entities. They could perform fishing related tasks: prevent bycatch from getting into the nets; detecting target fish; attracting targeted fish; estimating catch size; reducing catch if necessary; fertilizing plankton and feeding fish. Aerial vehicles: One or more autonomous aerial vehicles (AAV) could be integrated in the AFOS augmenting the overall built-in intelligence. AAVs vehicles can detect the movements of the target fish (e.g. many tuna species move close to the surface) thus contributing to the search/detection phase of the fishing operation. Also they can detect the movements accompanying other species (e.g. fish birds mammals) thus contributing to the bycatch avoidance feature of the AFOS. Further aerial devices can improve the communication among buoys and the fishing vessels as well as be critical for satellite communication and warning for passing craft thus addressing in an easier way for example the path planning problem for autonomous vessels 4 PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED Choice of autonomymodel: In the present analysis we will focus on the challenges related to fishing operations as well as the social and ecological issues emerging therein. We thereby neglect other factors associated with shipping in general such as navigation and Session 29: Blue Sky AAMAS 2018 July 10-15 2018 Stockholm Sweden 1194 transport which are being handled by other maritime researchers (e.g. [30]). The transition to semi-autonomy or full autonomy of fishing vessels will not be similar in every sector or country. It is very likely that it will take place in industrialized fishing nations such as Japan and Norway first but that traditional operations will for a period co-exist with autonomous operations. It is likely that autonomous and particularly semi-autonomous systems are prone to emerge first in small near-shore operations targeting valuable species. The technological transition raises several questions particularly as to the potential of full autonomy to achieve all the benefits enumerated in Section 1: should partial autonomy be even considered? But if not would it be possible that full autonomy is too complex to achieve in the near future given the state of the art? If partial autonomy is to be tried first how should this be done? System requiring support to operators? Operators relying on the system for automating part of their job? Who is (needed to be) embedded on the ship? Only the captain? Fishing crew? Nonfishing crew? Regardless the level of autonomy should vessels be macro-agents or MASs? Multi-agent interaction: Even though as indicated in Section 1 there is already some research about operating autonomous marine vehicles and sometimes using a MAS approach [21] with fishing operations being such a new application domain there are initial questions that have to be answered such as: How agents of the system relate to each other and to external systems (e.g. weather forecast)? How should agents cooperate locally to ensure global sustainability? How are decisions taken in an AFOSs (e.g. communication collaboration coordination tasks)? It seems that coordination is required in running AFOS. Then are new coordination mechanisms required (e.g. to avoid overfishing)? Do we need a new type of architecture for agents? Different agent protocols? How would the various combinations of AA be integrated (surface-underwater surface-aerial surface-underwater-aerial underwater-aerial)? System and human interactions: Moving into this domain more question arise: Who are the humans involved in autonomous fishing and why are they involved? Does the system needs them for operating? How do these humans interact with the system? How do humans control the system? What is the benefit from their interaction? How would the system interact with humans from outside the MAS itself such as representatives of law enforcement environmental non-governmental organisations or even human controlled vessels that try to steal the catch of the autonomous fishing system (piracy attacks)? How should the autonomous fishing system interact with the on-land parts of the owner of the fishing system or landing facilities (e.g. transfer of fishing data)? Ethics: Autonomous fishing is a rich environment for manifestation of multiple ethical concerns. Inside the fishing company decisions about the command and decision structure �company rules" for operation will have to be settled from the onset. Are there sufficient stop buttons placed in the correct places? Further open access to all the operational information to the legislator or law enforcement is expected to ensure full transparency. In a submerged world this can be the only way to ensure that companies operate according to desirable standards. To avoid local depletion of stocks there must be some agreement as to how to explore patches of resource among the operators without compromising individual economic efficiency that is �rules of the road". In addition there are ethical aspects connected to the design of the AAs be them AFVs APFGs AFOSs or parts of AFOSs. Should we design AAs that respect ethical principles? Should these agents be given the values of their owners? Should these agents follow social norms? How to design ethical rules for such agents? What would be development of standards of "acceptable" behaviour among multi-robotic agents that exploit shared natural resources? The ethical issues inherent to classic fishing operation will be inherited by the autonomous fishing such as the question of fishing in waters belonging to developing countries. In addition new issues will arise such as: should the MAS be knowledgeable about all the laws applicable in its operational domain or should it just follow the desire / rules of its owner thus opening for the possibility for the MAS to act illegally? How should agents with different private owners behave with each other (possibly in the case when one of the agents has performed an illegal activity) and towards similar agents owned by state authorities environmental non-governmental organisations or pirate systems? To what extent should the AFOS defend itself against human controlled pirate attacks? Society: Large scale utilization of autonomous fishing practices would lead to reorganisation of society in different respects. Displacement of labour from the operational fishing sector can be beneficial from for instance the perspectives of human safety health or well-being (e.g. more time with family). However the history of Norwegian coastal regions in the last 30 years shows that with increasing efficiency of the fishing sector at sea there has been a flight from coastal regions where normally fishers and family dwelled to the cities [2]. Nevertheless a focus on the catch and transport of fresh live fish has the potential to create new jobs in other sectors downstream along the coast that could compensate for that loss. From an organisational perspective it might be possible that fishing companies would re-organise and new forms of organisations will be formed to operate the various elements of AFOSs for example. For various reasons such as distance from law enforcement unclear regulatory regime increased public sensitivity these re-organised fishing companies and new forms of organisations might operate in a different way than those operating on land and there might be clear winners and losers in these circumstances.As inferred from other areas where robots were introduced [13 36] society might have a low level of acceptance of autonomous fishing operations and this might reflect on for example seafood consumption patterns. Thus it would be recommended to implement societal preparedness initiatives before and in parallel with the autonomisation process.If the change to autonomous fishing is going to happen how should this be implemented (incremental or mass-replacements)? Would the autonomous system render obsolete fishing crew skills (would �the captain�s nose" (i.e. human skill considered absolutely necessary for fishing [35]) become history?)? Legal aspects: Autonomous fishing systems as those presented in Figure 1 are in principle not limited by area or depth of operation which is to say that they can operate in the high-seas and capture pelagic demersal or sedentary species. This means that seen or unseen these systems may transverse easily different national and international jurisdictions. It is at this stage difficult to judge whether international law can accommodate this kind of activities and autonomous systems. But judging from the number Session 29: Blue Sky AAMAS 2018 July 10-15 2018 Stockholm Sweden 1195 of conflicts that have been fully or partially resolved by international law with regard to conventional vessels [23] one may suspect that international laws would need an update.Moreover there is the question of legal responsibility for the AFVs actions AFOSs as wholes or parts of these AFOSs. If they do something considered illegal who has to respond in front of the law? The experts informing the MAS design the MAS designer / engineer the owner of the AA (and in this case complexity would increase if various agents that are part of the same MAS have different owners with different views on legal compliance sustainability profits discards by-catch illegal fishing and all these agents participated in taking the decision to perform the illegal action)? 5 APPLICABILITY OF MULTIAGENT SYSTEMS Coordination techniques for optimizingAFOS performance: Considering AFVs and AFOSs MAS there are different ways to optimize system performance. Multiple autonomous systems which cooperate when belonging to the same owner and compete when belonging to different owners require a minimum amount of coordination. For instance they should avoid local patch depletion even if the system belongs to different owners a problem usually dealt with by optimum foraging theory. Furthermore AFOSs should be capable of coordinating the use of the various devices they rely on (e.g. fishing nets operations with of traps) jointly with ship operations (e.g. speed orientation). In addition advances in cybersecurity could play a role here [33]. Numerous techniques have been proposed for coordinating such heterogeneous and largescale MASs. Norms [5] and protocols [19] constitute classical tools for setting rules on behaviours interactions of possibly conflicting agents. Norms in particular can embed legal norms offering a strong step towards designing agents that comply with laws. Automated negotiation [8] can help reaching satisfactory outcomes between competing agents. Organizations [1 14 15] offer a usual tool for defining roles and duties between collaborating agents. Supporting human-to-human business: MASs offer numerous solutions for supporting human-to-human interactions (for example in our case interaction between companies active in the seafood supply chain). Due to the increasing amount of automation the system becomes well-informed on the status of the business or the vessel as a whole. Therefore MAS can be applied for supporting decision-making and for automating processes. Automated argumentation automated negotiation and agreement technologies [16 22 25] are solutions for facilitating decision-making in general and during company-to-company competitive interactions. Another classical benefit that MASs can offer to business lies in their capability for automating processes that were usually performed by humans [24] such as recording information (e.g. filling in the log-book for each fishing operation) triggering certain tasks (e.g. start the process of issuing catch certificates for the catch) and then warn impacted entities (e.g. informing about reaching the fishing quota allocated to that specific AFV). Relevant agent decision architectures:Agents to be deployed in autonomous fishing operations are expected to possess high cognitive capabilities such as belief-desire-intention (BDI) agents [29] or beyond [9]. Agents operating autonomous vessels have to be capable of committing to long-term goals (e.g. commit early to specific gear and area). They should be capable of reasoning for reaching these goals revising their plans and goals based on beliefs of the state of the world (e.g. weather forecast fish stocks potential technical failure). Furthermore these agents need capabilities for reasoning about coordination and thus adapt on the fly. As ethical issues are highly relevant in the context of autonomous fishing of common societal resources most probably agents would need to be given capabilities for making ethical decisions. They would need to be given values to comply to as well as logics for complying to ethical rules [6]. Likewise the respect of humans needs and values should be taken into consideration in the context of autonomous fishing operations. MAS offer decision architectures for reasoning about human values that could be relevant here [7]. Simulation-based modelling: The transition to AFVs APFG and AFOS is highly consequential on the society as a whole as well as on how fishing will be performed in the future. In this regards designing models for predicting the consequences of the evolution of fishing techniques and fishing activities organization is very important for avoiding dramatic outcomes of this shift. Social simulation offers a strong approach for evaluating the consequences of this transition on societies [20]. In addition fishing operations are temporally extended activities and as the state of fishing environment and conditions change in response to the fishing activity and contingencies it is necessary to incorporate on the fly new (real-time) information in the models based on which the AFOSs and/or elements of these systems operate. How to incorporate a variety of types of data e.g. oceanographic biological legal into simulations and other models represents a significant research direction. Moreover the major paradigm shift that the transition to autonomous fishing activities requires empowering stakeholders with an understanding of the changes the society will go through. Social simulation serious gaming and participative modelling provides a solution for facilitating this transition [3]. Interaction with humans: The domain of semi-autonomy is highly relevant for designing AFOS. In the short run the problem of designing AFVs APFG and AFOSs might be technically too complex (and/or socially to sensitive) for being handled by fully-autonomous agents. Therefore approaches for designing semiautonomous systems proposed by the MAS community [37] are of high relevance for designing these fishing systems (e.g. which part of decision is left to humans? How to connect the system and humans? How do humans help the system?). 6 CONCLUSION For various reasons notably cultural [26] autonomous fishing vessels might not be roving the seas in the very near future. However it is not difficult to imagine that various autonomous marine vehicles providing support to classic fishing vessels will be more and more deployed in fishing operations in this very close future. Developments in multiagent systems techniques can make a crucial contribution to solving some of the challenges raised by such operations and in a more distant time to come of the challenges raised by the fishing operating systems that include fully autonomous fishing vessels.

In order to assess how the LO performs as a policy instrument it is essential to understand the background objectives and motivation that led to the policy being adopted. With these objectives in mind a desk-study was first carried out to review relevant policy statements regulatory documents and academic literature. Secondly since the EU discard policy was driven by NGOs campaigns and public support a subsequent analysis was performed based on interviews of key environmental NGOs on their perception of the LO its objectives goals and state of its implementation (from legislation to control and enforcement). This study of the views of environmental NGOs complements the perspectives of other stakeholders as captured in workpackage 4 (i.e. the �fishermen� story� the �scientists� story� and the �managers� story�) as well as work realised in workpackage 2 to monitor the changes of stakeholder perceptions in relation to the LO during its progressive application to European fisheries. Possible conflicts and trade-offs in the introduction of the LO were then assessed based on two different approaches: a policy study and on an ecosystem service perspective. The objective of the policy analysis was to enumerate and discuss the interlinkages between the different management measures taken to date to deal with the LO in order to identifying its strengths and weaknesses and at the same time evaluate potential conflicts. Finally the ecosystem service approach was used conceptually to map the services that may be affected by the discard policy and again to identify potential objective conflicts and trade-offs between the landing obligation and other policies with a special focus on the CFP and the MSFD. The landing obligation was motivated by concerns of stock sustainability a desire to avoid wasteful practices and a need to improve the quality of fisheries data for stock assessment purposes. The LO has a clear objective to reduce unwanted catch by changing fishing practices but it is also an instrument to achieve the overall objectives of the CFP of stocks and fisheries sustainability. The interviews show that NGOs are frustrated with slow and inflexible governance process regarding the validation of technical innovations and selective gears and the reluctance of the sector to change. NGO representatives also expressed concern that control and monitoring regimes for the LO are insufficient. However NGOs have high expectations from the results from the DiscardLess project and many are already working collaborative with the fishing industry to find solutions to the envisage issues with the practical implementation of the LO. The policy study shows that implementation of the LO to date can be summarised by a slow uptake of some exemptions already provisioned in Art. 15 in association with additional policy changes not originally foreseen in the CFP. However fishing practices have not yet changed and there has been no significant reduction of unwanted catch as these policy measures in combination allowed for the fishing industry to continue operating as before. Finally regarding ecosystem services approach considering fisheries in terms of the services that can be affected by the management decisions governing the fisheries SECAS (socioecological complex adaptive systems) could be a useful approach that can potentially generate innovative ways to approach fisheries governance issues.

633680 1 Introduction The introduction of the Landing Obligation (LO) is one of the most significant reform elements in the 2013 Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) and represents a fundamental shift in the management approach to European Union (EU) fisheries from landings to catch. In order to assess how the discard policy performs as a policy instrument it is essential to understand the background objectives and motivation that led to the policy being adopted. The analysis expands and updates existing reviews of the development of the EU�s discard policy (e.g. Borges 2015). Firstly with a desk-study that reviewed relevant legislation STECF reports Advisory Councils advice NGOs (Non-Governmental Organizations) position papers and national administrations public statements relating to the LO. Since the EU discard policy was driven by environmental NGOs campaigns and public support a posterior analysis was carried out based on interviews of key environmental NGOs (in collaboration with workpackage 2) on their perception of the discard policy its objectives goals and state of its implementation (from legislation to control and enforcement). This study of the views of environmental NGOs complements the perspectives of other stakeholders as captured in workpackage 4 (i.e. the �fishermen� story� the �scientists� story� and the �managers� story�) as well as work realised in workpackage 2 to monitor the changes of stakeholder perceptions in relation to the LO during its progressive application to European fisheries. Possible conflicts and trade-offs in the implementation of the landing obligation were assessed based on a policy study and based on an ecosystem service approach. The objective of the policy study was to enumerate and discuss the interlinkages between the different management measures taken to date to deal with the LO in order to identifying its strengths and weaknesses and at the same time evaluate potential conflicts. In addition available insights on the economic outcomes and tradeoffs from case studies (from work package 2) were also used to support the overall assessment of strengths and weakness of the landing obligation. Finally the ecosystem service approach was used conceptually to map the services that may be affected by the discard policy and again to identify potential objective conflicts and tradeoffs between the landing obligation and other policies with a special focus on the CFP and the Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD). This document constitutes deliverable 7.3 of work package 7 of the DiscardLess project and at the same time describes progress with the development of task 7.1 i.e. the EU discard policy: background and objectives and assessment of potential conflicts. 2 Background and objectives of the LO 2.1 History of the EU policy on discards The discard problem has a long history in the EU and may be traced back to the foundation of the conservation policy of the CFP in 1983 which established Total Allowable Catches (TACs) and relative stability as the main instruments for resource management and the allocation of resources between member states (Holden and Garrod 1996). In the subsequent 10-year review of the CFP the European Commission (EC) described the CFP as �a resource     doi: 10.5281/zenodo.1238588 www.discardless.eu 10/60  This project has received funding from the European Union�s Horizon 2020 Framework Programme for Research and Innovation under grant agreement no. 633680 management/conservation policy founded exclusively on the fixing of TACs and their allocation in the form of quotas leading - in the absence of any real control over fishing capacity - to a race in terms of vessels and catches with inevitable discards at sea� (CEC 1991). The EC analyzed the discard problem in detail in a report on causes impact and solutions regarding the discard problem which it published the following year (CEC 1992). The regulatory framework included an obligation to discard fish not covered by available quota. In a mixed fisheries context fishermen were therefore allowed and required to discard fish they do not possess quota for or have filled the quota for while fishing for species for which they have remaining quota. Further fishermen were required to discard individuals below minimum landing sizes. In addition to obligatory discarding fishermen may illegally discard fish with low market value in order save onboard storing space or preserve quotas for higher valued specimens (highgrading). Finally fishermen may discard damaged fish (see also Crean and Symes 1994). The ECs comprehensive analysis of the discard problem considered a discard ban as one alternative but did not consider such a ban to be effective way to reduce discards mainly because of problems with controlling and policing it. The EC hence concluded: �in theory the simplest response to the problem posed by discards is to ban them. However it is not possible to propose an outright ban for all Community fisheries. If measures banning discards are to be acceptable and effective they should be taken only under certain conditions as regards both economics and controls� (European Commission 1991). Instead of a ban the EC recommends that a set of measures should be taken to reduce the discard problem such as measures to improve the selectivity of fishing gears increase regulatory flexibility and increase the marketability of fish that would otherwise be discarded. In 2001 the green paper preparing the 2002 reform of the CFP recommended the testing of discard bans in pilot projects (CEC 2001a) but it was only in march 2007 that the EC published a communication with the objective of initiating a discussion on a policy �to reduce unwanted bycatches and progressively eliminate discards in European fisheries� (CEC 2007). The communication recognized that discarding is a serious problem in European fisheries and noted that the main drivers of discarding was the use of single species TACs in mixed fisheries which obligates fishers to discard species for which they do not have quota. Further fishers were obliged to discard individuals below minimum landing size. The policy initiative was welcomed by the European Parliament (EP) and received feedback from various stakeholder organizations. In august 2008 a UK trawler was filmed in EU waters by the Norwegian Coastguard discarding considerable amounts of whitefish that it had caught in the adjacent Norwegian zone. The event was released in public media1 and increased public awareness and critique relating to the discard problem in European fisheries management. The discard problem was subsequently highlighted in the EC�s green paper (CEC 2009) which provided the basis for a broad consultation on the reform of the CFP. While a discard ban was advocated by a significant number of citizens the Commission�s summary of the received  1  http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/aug/13/fishing.endangeredspecies (last accessed 08.06.2016).     doi: 10.5281/zenodo.1238588 www.discardless.eu 11/60  This project has received funding from the European Union�s Horizon 2020 Framework Programme for Research and Innovation under grant agreement no. 633680 contributions noted that the ban appeared to be controversial. For instance the NWWAC warned that a discard ban could be counterproductive and recommended that discard reduction of discards should be planned for on a fisheries basis through increased selectivity and market measures. Along similar lines the European Parliament recommended that a progressive elimination of discarding should be pursued through creating incentives to enhance selectivity but if those incentives would render ineffective a discard ban should be implemented (European Parliament 2009). On the other hand some stakeholders groups such as the BSAC and the PELAC did not address discards in their submissions. Nevertheless a significant public pressure to end discarding was building up (Borges 2015). In particular the UK TV chef Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall launched a highly influential public campaign against discarding known as �Fish Fight�2 in October 2010 arguing the need for banning discards. In 2011 the Commission launched a proposal for a reformed basic regulation of the CFP which included an obligation for the industry to land catches of regulated species (CEC 2011a). The landing obligation was defined in relation to species with specific timelines starting from January 2014 for main pelagic species to be followed by cod hake and sole in January 2015 and demersal species in the subsequent year. The proposal was accompanied by an impact assessment (CEC 2011b) which considered the possible effects of landing obligation although these were not evaluated or assessed in detail. In summary the timeline of significant events leading to the EU landing obligation was: 2007 - Commission published a communication on a policy to �reduce unwanted by-catches and progressively eliminate discards� and subsequent public consultation; 2009 - Green paper and public consultation on the reform of the CFP; 2011 - CFP reform proposal includes landing obligation; further consultations with stakeholders; 2013 - The basic regulation of the CFP is adopted including Art. 15 on the landing obligation; 2015 - The landing obligation is introduced in the Baltic Sea and pelagic fisheries. 2.2 Objectives of the landing obligation: a study of the views of NGOs As described in the previous section the EU LO was mainly driven by environmental NGOs campaigns and public support. In this context the perception of key European environmental NGOs of the discard policy its objectives goals and state of its implementation (from legislation to control and enforcement) are therefore crucial to understand and evaluate the LO. This study aims first at increasing knowledge on the actions and participation of European environmental NGOs during the last CFP revision and second discovering how these actions have influenced the drafting of Article 15 of the CFP i.e. the landing obligation. The analysis of the NGOs discourse will clarify past and current actions regarding LO introduction including those undertaken within different Advisory Councils. Through the example of the LO NGOs vision about the European decision making process will provide new elements to improve EU fisheries governance a management system often viewed as top/down despite the important  2  http://www.fishfight.net/ (last accessed 08.06.2016).     doi: 10.5281/zenodo.1238588 www.discardless.eu 12/60  This project has received funding from the European Union�s Horizon 2020 Framework Programme for Research and Innovation under grant agreement no. 633680 changes generated by the introduction of the principles of the EU White Paper on Governance (CEC 2001b) on the 2013 CFP. Finally this NGOs views study complements the industry and managers �stories� capture in WP4 and the work realised in 2.5. 2.2.1 Methods Ten semi-structured interviews were conducted through skype with environmental NGO�s at EU and regional seas levels throughout April-May 2016. Seven main questions guided the interviews which were divided in three main themes: opinion on article 15 implementation process including the actions undertaken by NGOs and opinion on the use of discards and how sciences can support LO implementation. All text in italics below is quotations from the interviews. 2.2.2 Results NGOs� vision and lobby on the CFP Art. 15 During the consultation process of the CFP revision a large number of environmental NGOs were regrouped in a coalition called �Ocean 2012� to act collectively for European sustainable fisheries. Some others did not join the coalition and acted alone towards the same objective. �Fully documented catches� (recording of all catches) �unwanted catches should be solved in the water� �discard ban ideally to all species� were NGOs claims heard during the consultation process of the CFP. The ideas that regionalization of the CFP could facilitate a �discard ban or elimination of unwanted catches� or that a �discard ban for all species� could facilitate control without resorting to exemptions were also arguments used by conservationist NGOs to draw the attention of decision makers (European and National) and European citizens. None of these NGOs expected to reach such objective but article 15 and its provisions came out to the European public space as a result of political compromise rather than a conservation objective. Article 15 is not a response to conservation claims but aims at decreasing discard rates at least for all species under the quota system or under legal minimum size. This article was received positively by the NGOs because it is considered as the first step to achieve sustainable fisheries within the EU. But all of them consider it �unclear� in terms of objectives probably because it was not a subject of discussion during the CFP consultation process. For them it is viewed as a �top down decision�; and some think that it is responding more to the refusal of decision makers (Council of Ministers and MEP) to endorse the transferable concessions than to conservation of resource objectives. The article was �decided by the politicians� who �didn�t agree to a strong legal text�; and of course this result supports all those who do not want �strong measures�. So probably its lack of clarity is based on the fact that is a political agreement without taking into account scientific evidence and conservation objectives. The lack of consultation makes Art. 15 illegitimate mainly for fishing industry and to a lesser extent for NGOs.     doi: 10.5281/zenodo.1238588 www.discardless.eu 13/60  This project has received funding from the European Union�s Horizon 2020 Framework Programme for Research and Innovation under grant agreement no. 633680 During the discussion of the draft version of the article one NGO argued that the income earned from �undersize catches shouldn�t be reverted to fishing industry� but should support scientific work or monitoring efforts. This measure wants to avoid creating an incentive for catch of small fish. The progressive implementation of the LO is perceived �as help to the fishing sector�; and it is probably for that reason that the LO was firstly implemented in �easy� regional seas (e.g. Baltic) and to �easy� pelagic fisheries. The most difficult species and areas were left for the second phase because the fishing industry needs time to modify its practices. The timeframe of implementation is also considered by some NGOs �good because deadline is clearly defined for species and areas�. So it is easy to follow the implementation process. At the same time progressive implementation of LO is used as a good excuse by the fishing industry using the argument of confusion between species and areas to which LO is applied to justify their negative attitude towards LO. The example of MEDAC was given to illustrate this type of arguments. It seems that MEDAC did not know when the provisions of Art. 15 were applied to Mediterranean fisheries. Since then MEDAC understood the main provisions of the article and reacted by producing a position on MED fisheries that later became the joint recommendation which was not voted by one NGO members of the Advisory Council. The possibility of exemptions is also discussed by the NGOs. For them exemptions illustrate well the weakness of the objectives of Art. 15. The use of exemptions is not clearly defined in the article and it is the basis of the current exemption demands formulated by the industry and Member States. The wording used for some exemptions is perceived by a few NGOs as clear regarding high survival or de minimis exemptions. But one NGO wonders what �high survival� means and how it �is proved scientifically� although concludes by saying that the provision is �good�. The planned progressive implementation of the LO was viewed as positive because deadlines were fixed and gave enough time to the industry to implement this new rule by changing practices. But the issue of discards should be solved �in the water and not in the land�. Experience shows that the implementation process did not target this objective as it is focusing on landings and not on avoidance in the sea. This idea is defended by all the NGOs: for them �decrease of discards� is the main priority and if Art. 15 targets this objective they will support its implementation. For one of the NGOs discards is not a matter of �waste� (an argument used by the Commission to justify Art. 15 to the fishing industry) but of �sustainable fisheries�. So the objective is not to move discards from the sea to the land but to incentivize the use of more selectivity gears. NGOs think that there is room to improve the LO and achieve reduction of discards if regional discards plans and a roadmap to the LO implementation are established. But at the same time they observe that people are not yet convinced by the opportunities offered by LO. NGO�s vision about other stakeholders and LO implementation In 2002 the CFP reform established Advisory Councils (AC) at regional seas levels. NGOs and other stakeholders like consumers associations recreational fishers women associations and others can become members and represent 40% of the seats in the executive committees of the     doi: 10.5281/zenodo.1238588 www.discardless.eu 14/60  This project has received funding from the European Union�s Horizon 2020 Framework Programme for Research and Innovation under grant agreement no. 633680 ACs. Within ACs NGOs are defending their own positions and they are frequently opposed to the positions of the fishing industry which represents 60% of the seats in the executive committees. NGOs often consider that AC advices are representing fisheries interests; and this seems to be the case also concerning LO implementation due to the lack of clear objectives in Art. 15. Interventions of environmental NGOs in the implementation of LO usually take place through Advisory Councils. During the discussions undertaken within these institutions to formulate advices NGOs expressed their ideas which often pertain to sustainable fisheries or the end of overfishing. Reducing or avoiding discards is frequently discussed as part of LO implementation. Intergovernmental groups (e.g. Scheveningen/North Sea) discussing regional discards plans shall consult Advisory Councils in the working groups dealing with technical issues phasing of LO choke species etc. According to one of the NGOs this invitation is probably explained by the following reason: �MSs realised that EC is following the LO� and the �reputation of the regionalization of CFP� was based on their capacity to build discards plans. MSs had to consult ACs to produce the joint recommendations on discard plans. Apart from the transnational and diverse knowledge found within the AC thanks to the presence of the fishing industry and NGOs originating from different MSs these institutions have also better experience in transnational collaboration than civil servants of intergovernmental groups. And this helps to have broader knowledge than MSs and provides more acceptable advices to the Working Groups. Participation in these groups increased the awareness of the fishing industry concerning LO in the case of North Sea. The AC positioning towards LO evolved from the claim of �abolishment of Art. 15� because the choke species problem �will kill the industry� to �more mature advice� and technical discussion thanks to knowledge provided by NGOs. Understanding the reasons of choke species and acting was done thanks to the action of NGOs. �The fishing industry brings information of the problems to the table and we are trying to get solutions and trying to overcome problems�. This quotation shows the type of collaboration occurring within AC or at least in some of them. It is noticed that the fishing industry trusts NGOs and confidence relations were established between the two groups. But all fishers� representatives don�t have the same vision about LO: �some saying you can�t gently implement the LO and others suggest the opposite�. Collaboration within Advisory Councils offered to both groups the possibility to understand each other as well as the benefits that they can get from experiences and knowledge. For example NGOs understand why the fishing industry resists to changes necessary for LO implementation. They know that fishers will be heavily impacted by the LO from an economic point of view and fishing practices are the reason why fishers resist changes. Implementing LO at legal level may be an easy task but in practice it is very difficult and requires MSs to make choices. For example regarding species with 0 quotas and choke species one has to find solutions to solve the problem and go further into the process of implementation. For the moment few MSs try to be simultaneously progressive and defending their industry. The others are defending only their industry without trying to implement LO. And that despite the fact that Art. 15 gives MSs a very important role. Only MSs where authorities �are good in consulting people� try to go further in the implementation. In places where this tradition does not exist it is difficult to identify what is happening. This is the case in south European countries where the authorities do not have the will to change the current situation. This no-will is found also in that fact that SWW AC was not really consulted during the drafting of the joint recommendations. On the contrary in the     doi: 10.5281/zenodo.1238588 www.discardless.eu 15/60  This project has received funding from the European Union�s Horizon 2020 Framework Programme for Research and Innovation under grant agreement no. 633680 Mediterranean Sea MEDAC took the initiative to draft the joint recommendations probably because MSs did not have the capacity to reach an agreement. For one NGO MSs of south Europe �ignore LO implementation� and did not do a lot to �increase awareness� within the industry.  NGO�s views on the use of exemptions The first years of the progressive introduction of LO showed that MSs have a high preference for exemptions instead of using more effective tools as for example higher selectivity of fishing gears. This choice is criticized by NGOs because �exemptions for de minimis are short term temporary measures to ease the implementation of LO� and do not constitute adaptation strategies for discards elimination. They just show that MSs are not yet ready to change the situation. Once the exemptions are granted MSs do not inform correctly about discarding levels. In the past they reported �high discards� and now �they report lower percentage so there is an underreporting of discards�. Fishers still do not have to report the quantity of discards as for example in the pelagic fleet. Since they got the exemption no data on discards is available. The acceptance of exemptions by the EC is also criticized by NGOs. Despite the reservations made by STECF exemptions were granted by the Commission. One of the NGO acts to clarify the issue of exemptions in the next reform of the CFP by focusing its work �on exemptions and their legal point of view�. The European Parliament is another institution that is not really acting for LO implementation. For some of NGOs this institution is just asking the fishing industry to record discards and then they will take some decision. Probably this attitude is explained by the fact that MEPs have now more socio-economic objectives in their mind than resource conservation. Discussions are concentrating on �what we do on land and not about what we do at sea to avoid discards�. Adaptation strategies and tools NGOs have a lot of ideas about the strategies for the gradual elimination of discards. Here is a brief presentation of some of them to show the multitude of proposals. For NGOs the objective of LO is the elimination of discards and for that it is necessary to introduce more selective gears. In some regional seas the fishing industry was involved in trials to increase selectivity but in general only a few trials were carried out as MSs privilege exemptions rather than selectivity. Examples of trials on selective gears were given by the different NGOs. Increased selectivity of the gears will produce modification of fishing practices. The objective is to reduce discards at sea. According to them MSs do not give enough attention to selectivity and neither do the EU institutions despite the fact that LO real objective is �to make fisheries more selective and leave more fish in the water�. This original objective is not yet perceived and �many vessels continue business as usual�. Mapping areas with high discards and high number of juveniles is also perceived as necessary because it will help to close these areas to fishing activity. Some seasonal closures are also suggested as a solution to decrease discards.     doi: 10.5281/zenodo.1238588 www.discardless.eu 16/60  This project has received funding from the European Union�s Horizon 2020 Framework Programme for Research and Innovation under grant agreement no. 633680 Better management of quotas should be applied even a review of quotas allocations. MSs with few quotas have high rates of discards and with the issue of choke species they should stop fishing. For some the relative stability should be re-discussed but for that one needs political decisions. MSs like Belgium or Spain having few quotas are questioning the relative stability; but countries having enough quotas like France do not want to change it. The European Commission thought that LO will increase the number of swap of quotas between MSs; but in reality the opposite took place. MSs stopped exchanges of quotas because �they have now different values added values�. For some of the NGOs lack of quotas and highgrading are causes of discards; so it is necessary to meet and discuss how we can avoid that in a way to obtain LO implementation. The choke species issue is very important for �truly mixed fisheries and how to manage the quota�. Renegotiation of relative stability is needed. Monitoring Since the introduction of LO monitoring has not really been on the agenda of MSs and EU decision-makers. For NGOs the installation of cameras on board is probably the best solution. Few examples related to this use were given to prove the benefits. One of the NGO conducted a study about the use of different monitoring tools which showed the effectiveness of cameras. Cameras can be used by vessels more than 10 meters of length; and particularly in the Mediterranean others solutions should be found. The idea of cameras as a monitoring tool was abandoned as soon as France and Spain said no to this use in the CFP reform negotiations. EMFF can provide financial support to the European fleet either for more selective gear or for monitoring tools. Opinions about the use of discards NGOs did not focus on the use of unwanted catches because their objective is foremost to avoid catches and not land them. �Discards unwanted catches should be reduced before landed�. Use of unwanted catches should be discussed at EU level because it is necessary to clarify how that can be done. In NGOs opinion a political decision is necessary; but in case of use of discards for human consumption �there is need for discussion and of course these fishers should not go for waste�. Human consumption of unwanted catches does not meet a consensus between NGOs first because one has to know which category of unwanted catches should be used and second because there is always a risk of creating or maintaining markets for undersized fish in MSs where consumers appreciate them. For some only undersized fish could be used by industries already using wild fish (e.g. fishmeal pet food etc.) and unwanted catches due to highgrading should be forbidden for such use. �Highgrading marketable catch should be dealt with and ways to be sold should be found�. All NGOs want to avoid creating black market for undersized fish but particularly the NGOs in the Med. �Undersized fish should not be caught. But if caught it must not create a market nor give profits to fishers�. Of course NGOs are well aware that unwanted catches cannot be completely eliminated especially in mixed fisheries. For that reason all of them more or less put forward the following arguments: �No profit should be made from undersized fish� and do not exclude the possibility �to     doi: 10.5281/zenodo.1238588 www.discardless.eu 17/60  This project has received funding from the European Union�s Horizon 2020 Framework Programme for Research and Innovation under grant agreement no. 633680 compensate fishers for their work but the amount of such compensation should be very small� just enough to �cover their extra expenditures�. The objective is not to create incentives for catch of small fish. For that reason some of the NGOs suggest that income of the sale of unwanted catches should be given to other purposes such as �fisheries management� �to monitoring agency� or even to �scientific work� and not directly to fishers. Expectations from science For environmental NGOs science (and specifically the DiscardLess project) has a key role to play in the LO implementation because it can provide information of what is happening at sea. And also its results may help to improve selectivity of fishing gear or to improve quotas swapping. But to achieve that scientific advice and project results should be well formulated and be understandable by stakeholders. For that reason it is necessary to avoid too academically formulated results or to be able to popularize them in a way that is comprehensible for the industry decision-makers administration and usable by ACs or intergovernmental groups. This type of results can fill the gap between NGOs action and the fishing industry perception about LO implementation and use of more selective gear. The final objective is indeed to reduce unwanted catches. Communicate scientific results in the public space can support better decisions if they are well presented. This type of communication is challenging; so they suggest that the project �brings good real stories� to the EU public space. �Share good stories� and �flag best practices to avoid unwanted catches� that can contribute to LO implementation. The stories should bring out results of trials and implications lessons learnt and recommendations to move forward. For them the project is seen as a good umbrella: a mediator between fishers and NGOs. �Communication is essential to achieve sustainable fisheries objectives!� 2.2.3 Conclusions The landing obligation was motivated by concerns of stock sustainability a desire to avoid wasteful practices and a need to improve the quality of fisheries data for stock assessment purposes. The LO has a clear objective to reduce unwanted catch by changing fishing practices but it is also an instrument to achieve the overall objectives of the CFP of stocks and fisheries sustainability. The interviews show that NGOs are frustrated with slow and inflexible governance process regarding the validation of technical innovations and selective gears and the reluctance of the sector to change. NGO representatives also expressed concern that control and monitoring regimes for the LO are insufficient. However NGOs have high expectations from the results from the DiscardLess project and many are already working collaborative with the fishing industry to find solutions to the envisage issues with the practical implementation of the LO.     doi: 10.5281/zenodo.1238588 www.discardless.eu 18/60  This project has received funding from the European Union�s Horizon 2020 Framework Programme for Research and Innovation under grant agreement no. 633680 3 Policy trade-offs and conflicts 3.1 Policy study As established in the previous section the objective of the LO was foremost to reduce unwanted catch mainly by way of changing fishing behaviour. At the same time however it was recognized that the industry needed flexibility mechanisms to adapt to such a significant change in the way they operate. Therefore several regulatory measures and provisions were originally agreed and included in the CFP regulation as a priori possible policy exemptions of the LO while other measures were adapted through 2015 till 2018 with the phased introduction of the LO. These provisions are intended to deal with several issues that came into light with the LO such as: premature closure of fisheries as one species quota runs out no access to fisheries due to nonexistence quotas share for bycaught species and/or fisheries subjected to a 0 TAC species among others. 3.1.1 CFP LO regulatory provisions (Art. 15) The landing obligation introduced in the 2013 CFP in its article 15 includes four specific exemptions: species for which fishing is prohibited (dealt with in section 1.2.1.2) species that have high survival rates after being discarded catches which fall under the de minimis exemption and catches damaged by predators. High survival Species with scientific evidence of high survival rates after being discarded can have an exemption on the obligation to be landed. However the definition of what is high survival is still unclear while STECF (2013) has concluded that defining a single value cannot be scientifically rationalised and therefore assessing proposed exemptions on the basis of "high survival" need to be considered on a case-by-case basis taking account the specificities of the species and fisheries involved.  This provision has nevertheless been adopted in many fisheries since 2015. In pelagic fisheries the application of the exemptions for survival (and the de minimis) in some fisheries have provided the flexibility that allowed the industry to adapt to the LO without any significant change in their operations (PELAC 2015; MEDAC 2017). De minimis exemption The de minimis exemption is applicable under two conditions: if there is scientific evidence that increases in selectivity are very difficult to achieve or to avoid disproportionate costs of handling unwanted catches but only where the bycatch of the gear in question does not represent more than a certain percentage of the catch. As stated above in pelagic fisheries the application of the exemptions for survival and the de minimis in some fisheries have provided the flexibility that allowed the industry to adapt to the LO without any significant change in their operations (PELAC 2015; MEDAC 2017). Inter-species quota flexibilities     doi: 10.5281/zenodo.1238588 www.discardless.eu 19/60  This project has received funding from the European Union�s Horizon 2020 Framework Programme for Research and Innovation under grant agreement no. 633680 Catches that are caught in excess of quotas or for which the Member State has no quota may be deducted from the quota of the target species provided that they: i) do not exceed 9 % of the quota of the target species and ii) the stock of the non-target species is within safe biological limits (i.e. F<Flim and SSB>Blim). The inter-species quota flexibility (and de minimis) can provide flexibility in the system to better adjust catch compositions to resemble fishing opportunities and increase both ecological and economic sustainability. However STECF (2013) warns that these provisions could be used to legally increase catches well in excess of desired or intended levels and that they will require careful consideration if negative and unintended consequences are to be avoided. In practice inter-species quota flexibility was not used in 2016 and until April 2017 (Veits 2017). Predators damaged fish A further exemption to the LO was introduced with the Omnibus regulation (European Union 2015a) where caught fish damaged by predators should be returned to sea. The reason detailed in the regulation was that such catches �can constitute a risk to humans to pets and to other fish by virtue of pathogens and bacteria which might be transmitted by such predators�. Nevertheless this exemption was seen as particular important for Baltic Sea fisheries targeting salmon due to the increase in the predatory behaviour of seals consuming salmons caught mainly in longlines (Fitzpatrick and Nielsen 2016). This exemption has indeed been applied to salmon fisheries in the Baltic Sea. 3.1.2 Discard plans and minimum sizes Discard plans With the delay in the agreement of the multispecies multiannual plans foreseen in the 2013 CFP between European institutions and with the objective of introducing the LO progressively several so-called discard plans were in accordance with the CFP adopted by the EC between 2014 and 2017 through delegated acts. The discard plans identify the specific fisheries entering the LO and applicable exemptions by sea area for a period of three years based on joint recommendation by regional Member States groups in consultation with the relevant Advisory Councils. Although the discard plans were originally planned as an intermediate legislative measure to be substitute gradually by the agreed multiannual management plans in each sea basin these are now well established legislative procedures that continue to be adopted and amended regardless if the corresponding multiannual plan has already been adopted. Reduction of minimum sizes The 2013 CFP reform introduced specific provisions which allow changing minimum landings/conservation sizes under discard plans and multiannual plans still with the prevailing aim of ensuring the protection of juveniles of marine organisms. Catches below minimum conservation reference sizes (MCRS comparable but not equivalent to the previously known     doi: 10.5281/zenodo.1238588 www.discardless.eu 20/60  This project has received funding from the European Union�s Horizon 2020 Framework Programme for Research and Innovation under grant agreement no. 633680 MLS) have also limited use and cannot be sold for human consumption to avoid creating markets for undersized fish. In the Baltic Sea the size at which cod can be sold for human consumption was reduced in 2015 i.e. the MLS of 38 cm change to MCRS of 35 cm (European Union 2014a). As expected there was an increase in cod landings between 35-38 cm which in turn caused an increase in national quota consumption since Baltic cod stocks size composition is small (MRAG 2016). At the same time the industry reported difficulty in increasing gear selectivity due to the restrictions in the trawl gear allowed in the Baltic Sea (Baltic Sea Advisory Council 2016). This resulted in a decreased fishing selectivity by incentivizing commercialization of smaller size eastern cod while there was no apparent reduction in discard rates (ICES 2017a). In south western Atlantic waters anchovy caught in CECAF area 34.1.2 and in ICES subarea 9 also had a reduction in minimum size with the introduction of the LO in 2015 from a MLS of 12 cm to a MCRS of 9 cm (European Union 2014b). In the Skagerrak and Kattegat in 2016 Nephrops human consumption size was also reduced from 130 mm and 40 mm to 105 mm total and 32 mm carapace length respectively (European Union 2015b); while clams (Venus spp.) size in the Adriatic Sea went from 25 mm to 22 mm in 2017 (European Union 2016a). 3.1.3 Additional regulatory mechanism: TACs and prohibited species With the phased introduction of the LO between 2015 and the beginning of 2018 several other regulatory mechanisms have since been used to deal with the LO. TAC footnotes Historically the TAC & quota regulations have included footnotes in some pelagic stocks TACs (e.g. horse mackerel) detailing specific percentages (2% or 5%) of catches of non-target species (e.g. boarfish haddock whiting and mackerel) that can be taken as bycatch in pursue of that target TAC without being accounted for in the respective non-target stock but on the target pelagic TAC. However only in 2018 have the footnotes included the LO provisions on interspecies flexibility and its 9% maximum combined catch and more importantly that the nontarget stocks be within safe biological limits. As the catches of non-target stocks are not necessarily accounted for in their respective TACs there is a risk of overexploitation on those non-target stocks. STECF (2013 2017b) highlighted there is the potential to significantly increase the mortality on non-targeted bycatch species to levels inconsistent with achieving FMSY and to the extent that stock biomass could be reduced below safe biological limits. TAC increases Since 2015 catches by fisheries subject to the phased introduction of the LO (with some exemptions) should have been brought to shore and landed. To accommodate the predicted increase in landed catch from such fisheries the relevant 2015 2016 and 2017 TACs were increased in accordance with the estimated catch that formerly would have been discarded (Borges 2018). According to the European Commission (2017) TAC adjustments are part of the overall package of measures to implement the LO but they should nevertheless not jeopardise the FMSY objective or increase fishing mortality.     doi: 10.5281/zenodo.1238588 www.discardless.eu 21/60  This project has received funding from the European Union�s Horizon 2020 Framework Programme for Research and Innovation under grant agreement no. 633680 According to Borges (2018) of the 40 64 and 88 TACs under the LO between 2015-2017 respectively; around 30% the majority of which being TACs for demersal stocks were increased in 2016-2017 to account for the LO and of these 10 TACs were set already above landings advice before any adjustments were made. Therefore the author concludes that the LO is likely to have contributed to TAC increases above maximum advised catch in 2016 and particularly in 2017 to accommodate the predicted increase in landed catch and will continue to do so until 2019 when all EU TAC regulated stocks and fisheries in the Atlantic come under the LO.   TACs suppression Removing TACs from annual TAC regulations so that associated stocks are removed from the LO has been put forward by several stakeholders as a way to deal with problematic stocks i.e. where discarding are high due to low commercial value and/or where quotas are insufficient to cover catches. In 2017 following a request from the EC ICES assessed the sustainability risk to the stock of dab and flounder of having no catch limits to be low as long as dab and flounder remains largely bycatch species (ICES 2017b). With this advice the EC proposed and Council agreed to delete the combined TAC for dab and flounder in the North Sea (European Commission 2017). With the suppression of the TAC these two stocks were removed from the LO and no longer constitute a risk for premature closure of the target fisheries for plaice and sole where they are bycaught. However they continue to be discarded in high numbers have low survival after discarding and low commercial value but continue to be caught in fisheries that no longer have the incentive to improve selectivity. It is expected that several more TACs will be deleted from the TAC & quota regulations during 2018 according to the positions voiced by industry and DG MARE (European Commission 2017) representatives. Zero TAC In the TAC 2017 regulation (European Union 2017) picked dogfish (spurdog Squalus acanthias) was listed as a prohibited species. Specimens should therefore not be harmed and if caught should be released immediately with the exception for vessels operating in a specific area where landings up to 270 tonnes of dead picked dogfish are allowed as long as vessels are engaged in a members state �bycatch avoidance programmes�. Furthermore a vessel engaged in the by-catch avoidance programme may land not more than 2 tonnes per month of picked dogfish that is dead at the moment when the fishing gear is hauled on board. The listing of spurdog in the prohibited species list but with a TAC has initiated a discussion on how to deal with zero TAC species under the LO: in which regulation species should be listed as prohibited how species are chosen to be in the prohibited species list their level of protection and the different levels of enforcement. NGOs position is that designating stocks with zero TAC advice as prohibited species will not protect them from overfishing and in itself provides little incentive for fishers to improve the selectivity of their fishing practices.     doi: 10.5281/zenodo.1238588 www.discardless.eu 22/60  This project has received funding from the European Union�s Horizon 2020 Framework Programme for Research and Innovation under grant agreement no. 633680 In summary at least one elasmobranches species has been recently added (and removed) from the prohibited species list when it posed a specific issue with the implementation of the LO namely on not allowing fisheries to begin or closing fisheries prematurely. Listing however a species in the prohibited species list means discarding can continue and without a post-release high survival this measure adds little to the sustainability of the stock. Prohibited species list Both the annual TAC and the technical measures regulations include a list of species for which the deliberate catching retention on board transhipment or landing is prohibited. Furthermore when caught specimens should not be harmed and should be promptly released back into the sea. Species listed in CITES Appendix I are included in the prohibited list. However except for when listed in CITES no other specific criteria is known granting inclusion. As stated in the previous section on zero TACs several species and stocks have been recently added and removed from the list when they pose a specific issue with the implementation of the LO. According to STECF (2017c) the prohibited species list should ideally only be used for species which are biologically sensitive to any exploitation. Without additional management measures to improve survival listing a species will not necessarily lead to a decrease in mortality. Furthermore the decision to include or remove any species onto or off the prohibited species list should be made according to transparent criteria developed in a participatory process. 3.1.4 Technical measures Technical measures at EU level are specified through several regulations dating back to 1998 when the original technical measures regulation was adopted (Council Regulation (EC) No 850/98). This regulation specifies areas and seasons where fishing is prohibited prohibited fishing methods minimum landing sizes minimum mesh sizes among many other measures to minimise the impact of fishing in the marine environment. In light of the reformed CFP to simplify rules and to allow for the introduction of the LO the EC has put forward a new framework proposal for technical conservation measures (European Commission 2016a). In this this proposal specific targets are set namely that catches of marine organisms below MCRS do not exceed 5% by volume. The regulation is still in negotiations between European institutions and trilogue has yet to begin but both the Council and the EP have somewhat weakened the targets proposed by the EC: for Council catches under MCRS �are reduced as far as possible� (Council of the European Union 2017) while for the EP catches under MCRS �are progressively reduced to specific levels for key fisheries� but it is left for MSs to decide on the levels and fisheries (European Parliament 2018). Furthermore while the proposed regulation is not yet adopted the regulatory changes necessary to allow for different gear configurations to be used to increase selectivity have not been made rendering at present several gear modifications that decrease unwanted catches illegal. 3.1.5 Multiannual management plans There has also been indirect effects of the LO in other fisheries management measures. The argument that the reality of mixed fisheries associated with the LO and reaching Maximum Sustainable Levels (MSY) is incompatible has been gaining momentum at European level.     doi: 10.5281/zenodo.1238588 www.discardless.eu 23/60  This project has received funding from the European Union�s Horizon 2020 Framework Programme for Research and Innovation under grant agreement no. 633680 FMSY upper range The management plans in the reformed CFP have no explicit harvest control rules (HCRs) but include FMSY ranges between which fishing opportunities can be set when pre-determined conditions are met (European Commission 2016b; European Union 2016b). The use of the FMSY upper range has been justified to allow for mixed fisheries to adapt to the LO. Managers argued that extra flexibility is needed to cope with the LO and avoid premature fisheries closures while NGOs defend that the objective of �above MSY levels� enshrined in the CFP is not in line with any F value above FMSY. It seems clear that the harvest control provisions detailed in the multiannual plans already agreed and proposed i.e. when FMSY ranges and additional management measures are applicable are not clear and leave many unanswered questions. Target and bycatch species In 2016 the EC proposed a new multiannual management plan for the North Sea basin for several commercial target species (European Commission 2016b). The new plan proposal considers species: a) that should be managed according to MSY (FMSY by 2020) b) species that may be managed according to the precautionary approach if MSY scientific advice is not available and c) other species not subject to catch limits to be managed based on the precautionary approach. De facto these new provisions establish a difference between target and bycatch species and to what level they should be managed under the CFP. The argument that flexibility is needed from industry and managers is contra-balanced by NGOs that the CFP MSY objective is applicable to all species regardless is they are commercial or not. 3.1.6 Monitoring control and enforcement Postponement of serious infringement Failing to comply with the landing obligation is categorized as a serious infringement under the control regulation (Regulation (EC) No. 1224/2009; European Commission 2009) but a 2-year delay was agreed in the so-called Omnibus regulation in 2015. Sanctions only took effect from the 1 January 2017 (European Union 2015a); from this date MSs had to start applying the points system for illegal discarding. Although the omnibus regulation did not delay the enforcement and control of the LO MSs have taken a soft approach in these two first years of the introduction of the LO and have focused on information sharing and training activities rather than on the LO compliance (STECF 2017a). Reporting on the implementation of the LO The Omnibus regulation (European Union 2015a) introduced the obligation to the EC to submit an annual report starting in 2016 until 2020 on the implementation of the landing obligation. This report should be based on information given by the Member States the Advisory Councils and other relevant sources.     doi: 10.5281/zenodo.1238588 www.discardless.eu 24/60  This project has received funding from the European Union�s Horizon 2020 Framework Programme for Research and Innovation under grant agreement no. 633680 The 2015 and 2016 MSs reports were reviewed and summarised by STECF (2016 2017a) and show a qualitative analysis of the efforts made by MSs on the different areas of the LO implementation. Nevertheless in 2017 STECF notice that �overall Member States indicate that difficulties encountered so far have been minimal but several reports have highlighted that the most significant issue they face is the industries� reluctance to implement the landing obligation despite considerable efforts to disseminate information to them. They also report that fishers seem slow to change fishing practices; and in many areas a �business as usual� mentality seems to prevail�. Revision of the control regulation EC is proposing a revision of the Control Regulation (EC) No. 1224/2009 (European Commission 2009) with a draft proposal predicted to be released publicly by May 2018. The EC has started a discussion on the elements of this review and have stated their intention to include the use of Remote Electronic Monitoring (CCTV and sensors system) to monitor the implementation of the LO on selected fisheries on a voluntary basis (European Commission 2017b). In this context and in a letter inviting inputs from Advisory Councils on its proposal for establishing Specific Control and Inspection Programmes the EC (European Commission 2018a) stated that �independent research audits of the MS control systems conducted by the Commission and the 'last-haul' and other project initiatives driven by the EFCA alongside the MS authorities all indicate a general lack of compliance with the LO and that illegal and unrecorded discarding is widespread�. 3.1.7 Conclusions It is clear that the implementation of the LO to date can be summarised by a slow uptake of some exemptions already provisioned in Art. 15 in association with additional policy changes not originally foreseen in the 2013 CFP. However fishing practices have not changed and there has been no significant reduction of unwanted catch as these policy measures in combination with insufficient monitoring and control allowed for the industry to continue operating mostly as before. 3.2 Ecosystem services approach Finally possible conflicts and trade-offs in the implementation of the landing obligation were assessed based on an ecosystem service approach. Fisheries are socio-ecological complex adaptive systems (SECAS Levin et al. 2013; Ostrom 2009) embedded in various services and disservices provided by ecosystems (Armstrong et al. 2012; Liquete et al. 2013; Dunn 2010). The flow of all these services (and disservices) can be potentially affected by any management measure that modifies the collective behaviour of fish and humans (i.e. the main agents in this SECAS) and the emergent properties of the fisheries SECAS as these behaviours and properties feedback influencing the environment in which the SECAS is embedded. This understanding can enrich the discussions around the necessity to alter or even discontinue human activity that affects or is affected by the services (Huntsinger and Oviedo 2014) facilitating comparisons of management alternatives (Granek et al. 2010) as services that are valued may be perceived to have particular power as an advocacy tool for environmental concerns (Waylen et al. 2014).     doi: 10.5281/zenodo.1238588 www.discardless.eu 25/60  This project has received funding from the European Union�s Horizon 2020 Framework Programme for Research and Innovation under grant agreement no. 633680 If the decision context for utilizing the concept of ecosystem services (ESSs) is to promote understanding and to educate a larger public about the services and benefits that wellfunctioning ecosystems provide to humans then the ESSs domain specialty literature recommends the use of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment�s (MEA 2005) Ecosystem Service framework (Fisher et al. 2009). Thus services emanating from ecosystems associated with fisheries potentially include supporting (i.e. services that are necessary for the production of all other ESSs i.e. they feed into provisioning regulating and cultural services (e.g. soil formation nutrient cycling production of oxygen primary production resilience)) provisioning (i.e. the products (goods) directly obtained from ecosystems (e.g. food such as fish water fuel genetic resources)) regulating (i.e. the benefits obtained from the regulation of habitats and ecosystem processes (e.g. climate regulation water purification natural carbon sequestration and storage waste absorption)) and cultural (i.e. the nonmaterial benefits people obtain from ecosystems through e.g. spiritual enrichment (artistic inspiration reflection cognitive development marvel at the emergent properties of natural processes) recreation or aesthetic experiences) services as described by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA 2005). Ecosystem disservices (ESDs) are understood as all negative effects (i.e. harmful unpleasant or unwanted) on human well-being caused by natural or semi-natural ecosystems natural conditions or biological organisms (Lyytim�ki 2014). The identification of these aspects are important for knowledgebased decision making in relation to policies for human interactions with nature and also to better assess the outputs of policies. Using the ESSs and ESDs framework to analyse a fishery management measure such as the EU LO (European Commission 2018b) enables a richer and more encompassing view of the benefits and costs emanating from this policy change. The push for the LO largely came from outside of fisheries where public outcry regarding the wasteful practice of discarding initiated the policy change in EU fisheries (Borges 2015). The underlying idea is however based on the understanding that human welfare is linked to marine organisms in more ways than just purely based on what we eat i.e. fisheries incorporate more than solely provisioning services. This is however a concept we claim is still not well included in fisheries management where even newer management focus is still largely based on single stocks (Eikeset et al. 2013; Gullestad et al. 2014) in spite of the push for ecosystem based management including broader ecological and social issues. The reason for this state of affairs may of course be due to fisheries management being largely sectorial without incentives for a broader view on the marine services than purely the provisioning of fish. However the reasons may be even more fundamental in relation to how relevant scientists and managers view the ocean and its resources. The success of the LO as of any policy measure depends on the involved parties in our case fishers fisheries managers fisheries scientists (and possibly other stakeholders) realizing the socio-cultural aspects of the LO origins but also the socio-cultural workings of the fishing activity itself i.e. how fishers understand and consequently respond to the LO will determine its success. Using a ESSs approach might provide the stakeholders with broader toolset to explore if not even achieve this realization. However looking at fisheries through the lenses of ESSs is not an easy task especially when one has to evaluate the impact of a specific policy on such services. This fact is proven by the mapping exercise we have employed as part of the DiscardLess (DiscardLess 2018) project during the 2016 project annual general meeting in     doi: 10.5281/zenodo.1238588 www.discardless.eu 26/60  This project has received funding from the European Union�s Horizon 2020 Framework Programme for Research and Innovation under grant agreement no. 633680 Boulogne-Sur-Mer France. Building on a concise conceptual description of ESSs and ESDs from the scientific literature and the preliminary results of the DiscardLess exercise the specific objective of this study is twofold: 1. to identify and characterize the most important ESSs and disservices in which fisheries SECAS are embedded; 2. to map the services/disservices that may be affected by the discard policy (i.e. the landing obligation). 3.2.1 Methodology At the DiscardLess annual project meeting in March 2016 the project members covering a variety of domains but mainly natural scientists were given a brief PowerPoint presentation about ESSs which were further referred to in the questionnaire cultural aspects and the questionnaire itself which was subsequently distributed. Forty four out of the 46 project members present handed in the filled in questionnaires. The first section of the questionnaire consisted of personal information (though not sufficient to identify persons). One central section of the questionnaire requested identification of ESSs in a specified ocean area that the respondent was most familiar with how these services were perceived affected by the fishery and the landing obligation and how important the services were deemed to be. Through literature review we have identified literature describing the most important ecosystems in which fisheries as SECAS are embedded. Employing content analysis of this literature (Silverman 2004) we have identified and characterized the most important ESSs and ESDs in which fisheries SECAS are embedded. Using the data from the DiscardLess 2016 survey and theoretical reasoning (Harman 2009) we have mapped the ESSs/ESDs that may be affected by the landing obligation. The effects of the landing obligation should be read with caution as the results presented in this study are based only on the perception about the topic of the DiscardLess 2016 survey participants and of the authors of the study and not on empirical research. 3.2.2 Results The main group of scientists replying the DiscardLess ESS questionnaire were fisheries biologists as well as a large group of ecologists besides social scientists/economists and some more technology-oriented scientists (engineering mathematics chemistry food technology computer sciences) with two respondents indicating a multidisciplinary background in fisheries biology/ecology and social sciences (Figure 1 in Annex). Employing this MEA framework we have identified 39 ESSs and 17 disservices in which fisheries SECAS are embedded (Table 2 in Annex). The participants identified some of these ESSs but for the most part they identified provisioning services of fish and the supporting services of biodiversity and habitat (Figure 2 and 3 Table 1 and 3 in Annex). A vast majority of these can be expected to be affected by the landing obligation even though it is not clear in which way as can be interpreted from the responses to the survey (Figure 6 and 7 Table 4 in Annex). As further exploration tracks it would be interesting to repeat the exercise of crossing ESSs/ESDs with any other management objective proposed by the Common Fisheries Policy or the Marine Strategy Framework Directive and afterwards analyse the ESSs/disservices found at the intersection between the effects of landing obligation and the effects of the other management objective.     doi: 10.5281/zenodo.1238588 www.discardless.eu 27/60  This project has received funding from the European Union�s Horizon 2020 Framework Programme for Research and Innovation under grant agreement no. 633680 3.2.3 Conclusions Considering fisheries in terms of the services that can be affected by the management decisions governing the fisheries SECAS could be a useful approach that can potentially generate innovative ways to approach fisheries governance issues. This understanding can enrich the discussions around the necessity to alter or even discontinue the human activity that affects or is affected by the services facilitating comparisons of management alternatives. Employing the MEA framework we have identified 39 ESSs and 17 disservices in which fisheries SECAS are embedded. The participants identified some of these ESSs but for the most part they identified provisioning services of fish and the supporting services of biodiversity and habitat. A vast majority of these can be expected to be affected by the landing obligation even though it is not clear in which way. 4 Overall conclusions The landing obligation was motivated by concerns of stock sustainability a desire to avoid wasteful practices and a need to improve the quality of fisheries data for stock assessment purposes. The LO has a clear objective to reduce unwanted catch by changing fishing practices but it is also an instrument to achieve the overall objectives of the CFP of stocks and fisheries sustainability. The interviews show that NGOs are frustrated with slow and inflexible governance process regarding the validation of technical innovations and selective gears and the reluctance of the sector to change. NGO representatives also expressed concern that control and monitoring regimes for the LO are insufficient. However NGOs have high expectations from the results from the DiscardLess project and many are already working collaborative with the fishing industry to find solutions to the envisage issues with the practical implementation of the LO. It is clear that the implementation of the LO to date can be summarised by a slow uptake of some exemptions already provisioned in Art. 15 in association with additional policy changes not originally foreseen in the 2013 CFP. However until now fishing practices have not changed and there has been no significant reduction of unwanted catch as these policy measures in combination allowed for the industry to continue operating as before. Finally regarding ecosystem services approach considering fisheries in terms of the services that can be affected by the management decisions governing the fisheries SECAS could be a useful approach that can potentially generate innovative ways to approach fisheries governance issues. This understanding can enrich the discussions around the necessity to alter or even discontinue the human activity that affects or is affected by the services facilitating comparisons of management alternatives.

A fishery can be defined as �the complex of people their institutions their harvest and their observations associated with and including a targeted stock or group of stocks (i.e. usually fish) and increasingly the associated ecosystems that produce said stocks� (Link 2010). As such there is �an obvious and important need to identify and value a fishery and its associated ecosystem� (Link 2010). In addition there is a need to identify and value services emanating from the fishery and the ecosystems with these services potentially including supporting provisioning regulating and cultural services as described by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA 2005). Thinking about fisheries in terms of the services that can be affected by the management decisions governing the fisheries SECAS could be a useful approach that can potentially generate innovative ways to assess fisheries governance. Even though the ecosystem services (ESSs) approach is different to an ecosystem approach the former could be helpful for understanding a system in terms of flows of services and this understanding can support holistic and equitable management particularly because it allows valuation of changes in specific ESS flows and comparison of previously incomparable resources (Waylen et al. 2014). Furthermore services that are valued may be perceived to have particular power as an advocacy tool for environmental concerns (Waylen et al. 2014). This understanding can enrich the discussions around the necessity to alter or even discontinue human activity that affects or is affected by the services (Huntsinger and Oviedo 2014) facilitating comparisons of management alternatives (Granek et al. 2010). Increased operationalization of an ESSs framing could lead to a greater understanding of the trade-offs between elements of the fisheries system cross-scale dynamics and impacts on resilience (Hodbod and Adger 2014). In this study we argue that fisheries SECASs are embedded in ecosystem services (ESSs) and disservices (ESDs) whose flows can be affected by any human decision that brings changes in the SECAS processes. Using the ESSs and ESDs framework to analyze a fishery regulation such as the European Union (EU) Landing Obligation (LO) (European Commission 2018) enables a richer and more encompassing view of the benefits and costs emanating from this policy change.     doi: 10.5281/zenodo.1238588 www.discardless.eu 35/60  This project has received funding from the European Union�s Horizon 2020 Framework Programme for Research and Innovation under grant agreement no. 633680 Discards are fish and other organisms which are caught accidentally in fishing gear and are thrown back in the sea (European Commission 2007). In most cases discarded organisms do not survive. A study performed by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) showed a very low rate of discards in the Mediterranean and the Black Sea (4.9%) compared to a much higher rate (13%) in the northeast Atlantic (European Commission 2007). Within EU fisheries discard rates ranged widely from negligible in the herring and sprat fishmeal fisheries in the Baltic Sea to 70-90% in a number of major demersal trawl fisheries (European Commission 2007). Sometimes in those fisheries which have the worst records for discarding the practice can destroy almost as much economic value as the fishery is able to create (European Commission 2007). The EU LO put in place in 2015 to reduce the bycatch and discarding of unwanted or unmarketable fish lies within the realm of management defined as ecosystem-based management though not necessarily emanating from it. Indeed the push for the LO largely came from outside of fisheries where public outcry regarding the wasteful practice of discarding initiated the policy change in EU fisheries (Borges 2015). The underlying idea is however based on the understanding that human welfare is linked to marine organisms in more ways than just purely based on what we eat i.e. fisheries incorporate more than solely provisioning services. This is however a concept we claim is still not well included in fisheries management where even newer management focus is still largely based on single stocks (Eikeset et al. 2013; Gullestad et al. 2014) in spite of the push for ecosystem based management including broader ecological and social issues. The reason for this state of affairs may of course be due to fisheries management being largely sectorial without incentives for a broader view on the marine services than purely the provisioning of fish. However the reasons may be even more fundamental in relation to how relevant scientists and managers view the ocean and its resources. The success of the LO as of any policy measure depends on the involved parties in our case fishers fisheries managers fisheries scientists (and possibly other stakeholders) realizing the socio-cultural aspects of the LO origins but also the socio-cultural workings of the fishing activity itself i.e. how fishers understand and consequently respond to the LO will determine its success. Using an ESSs approach might provide the stakeholders with broader toolset to explore if not even achieve this realization. However looking at fisheries through the lenses of ESSs is not an easy task especially when one has to evaluate the impact of a specific policy on such services. This fact is proven by the mapping exercise we have employed as part of the DiscardLess (DiscardLess 2018) project during the 2016 project annual general meeting in Boulogne-sur-Mer France. Building on a concise conceptual description (Section 2) and the preliminary results of the DiscardLess exercise (Section 3) the specific objective of this this study is twofold: 1. to identify and characterize the most important ESSs and disservices in which fisheries SECAS are embedded (Section 4); 2. to map the services / disservices that may be affected by the discard policy (i.e. the landing obligation) (Section 4). Conceptual framework Ecosystem services and disservices Although extensively criticized for being anthropocentric (Silvertown 2015) for not including intrinsic values (Davidson 2013) for not including indigenous and local knowledge (D�az et al. 2018) and for the commodification of nature (McCauley 2006) the ESSs concept has gained considerable interest inside and outside of science (Schr�ter et al. 2014; Tancoigne et al. 2014).     doi: 10.5281/zenodo.1238588 www.discardless.eu 36/60  This project has received funding from the European Union�s Horizon 2020 Framework Programme for Research and Innovation under grant agreement no. 633680 There are several ESS classification schemes (Hattam et al. 2015) and the choice of using one scheme over another has to be based on both the characteristics of the ecosystems of interest and a decision context for which the concept of ESSs is being mobilized (Fisher Turner and Morling 2009). If the decision context for utilizing the concept of ESSs is to promote understanding and to educate a larger public about the services and benefits that wellfunctioning ecosystems provide to humans then the ESs domain specialty literature recommends the use of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment�s (MEA 2005) Ecosystem Service framework (Fisher Turner and Morling 2009). Thus considering the objectives of this study we will in the following use the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA) in our discussion of fisheries. This framework includes supporting services that feed into the direct services to humans the provisioning regulating and cultural services. A number of newer frameworks such as TEEB CICES and IPBES do not include supporting services explicitly in their ESSs portfolio (CICES 2013; IPBES 2017; TEEB 2010). The motivation for not including the supporting services is largely due to the issue of double counting values. When monetarily estimating the value of ESSs supporting services cannot be valued separately as their values are inherently included in the value of the direct services that they feed into. We have however chosen to apply the MEA framework due to this inclusion as in fisheries the stock and flow elements such as fish stock and harvests are central. Though �regulating contributions� in the IPBES �Nature�s Contributions to People� concept may be thought to include such stocks and their maintenance this is not explicitly described as only habitat maintenance is included (IPBES 2017). In our study stock maintenance will in addition to habitat maintenance be central ESSs which in the MEA framework can both be included in supporting services. ESSs are the direct and indirect benefits people obtain from ecosystems (MEA 2005); in this study we consider as ESS any such benefit regardless if it is supported by living organisms or not (e.g. dredge materials oil or aggregates wind) i.e. both biotic and abiotic aspects. The MEA identified four main categories of ESSs (MEA 2005; Kragt and Robertson 2014; Armstrong et al. 2012): Provisioning services = the products (goods) directly obtained from ecosystems (e.g. food such as fish water fuel genetic resources); Supporting services = services that are necessary for the production of all other ESSs i.e. they feed into provisioning regulating and cultural services (e.g. soil formation nutrient cycling production of oxygen primary production resilience). Their impacts on people are usually indirect both physically and temporally whereas changes in the other categories have relatively direct impacts on people. Regulating services = the benefits obtained from the regulation of habitats and ecosystem processes (e.g. climate regulation water purification natural carbon sequestration and storage waste absorption); Cultural services = the nonmaterial benefits people obtain from ecosystems through e.g. spiritual enrichment (artistic inspiration reflection cognitive development marvel at the emergent properties of natural processes) recreation or aesthetic experiences. One more aspect of the ESSs concept is that it potentially opens for the idea that nature not only provides benefits to humans but may also reduce our utility in some situations or in fewer     doi: 10.5281/zenodo.1238588 www.discardless.eu 37/60  This project has received funding from the European Union�s Horizon 2020 Framework Programme for Research and Innovation under grant agreement no. 633680 words it opens for ecosystem disservices (ESDs) (Dunn 2010) i.e. all negative effects (i.e. harmful unpleasant or unwanted) on human well-being caused by natural or semi-natural ecosystems natural conditions or biological organisms (Lyytim�ki 2014). Though sometimes a controversial concept (Villa et al. 2014) ESDs are well-known also historically (Friess 2016). In our case the concept of dis-services is less problematic as treating fisheries as a part of human interaction with nature thereby providing ESSs clearly must open for fisheries also providing ESDs i.e. reducing benefits to humans from ecosystems. Indeed the discussion as to whether fisheries or other human impacts altering the structure of marine ecosystems similar to what agriculture does on land actually provides ESs or ESDs is an ongoing debate regarding many ocean areas (Howarth et al. 2014; Falk-Petersen 2014). In economic theory the uncompensated impact of one agent�s behavior upon another agent is called an externality or an external effect. Regardless whether dis-services are the result of the natural functioning of an undisturbed ecosystem or they are the effects or side-effects of human influence the one and same ecosystem function can be perceived as a service or dis-service depending on the context knowledge and values of the person making the evaluation (Lyytim�ki 2014). The identification of these aspects are important for knowledge-based decision making in relation to policies for human interactions with nature and also to better assess the outputs of policies.  The ecosystem service Discardless 2016 survey At the DiscardLess annual project meeting in March 2016 the project members covering a variety of domains but mainly natural scientists were given a brief PowerPoint presentation about ESSs (see Appendix 1) for an overview of the ESSs which were further referred to in the questionnaire cultural aspects and the questionnaire itself which was subsequently distributed. Forty four out of the 46 project members present handed in the filled in questionnaires. The participants spent up to 45 minutes filling in this form. Most of the respondents had no comments to the questionnaire but a handful expressed that it was demanding. The first section of the questionnaire consisted of personal information (though not sufficient to identify persons). One central section of the questionnaire requested identification of ESSs in a specified ocean area that the respondent was most familiar with how these services were perceived affected by the fishery and the landing obligation and how important the services were deemed to be (see Appendix 2 for the ESS segment of the questionnaire). The motivation for the survey was to assess the presence of ESSs how well known different services were for different scientists and how fisheries and the landing obligation might impact these services. Some preliminary central results from this survey are presented in the following.     doi: 10.5281/zenodo.1238588 www.discardless.eu 38/60  This project has received funding from the European Union�s Horizon 2020 Framework Programme for Research and Innovation under grant agreement no. 633680  Figure 1 Disciplinary area of survey participants (N=44). The main group of scientists were fisheries biologists as well as a large group of ecologists besides social scientists/economists and some more technology-oriented scientists (engineering mathematics chemistry food technology computer sciences) with two respondents indicating a multidisciplinary background in fisheries biology/ecology and social sciences. (Figure 1).  Figure 2. Total number of ecosystem service types mentioned by participants (N=219). Amongst the four Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA 2005) services (provisioning regulating cultural and supporting) it is the supporting services that are most often mentioned by the participants in the survey followed by cultural services then the provisioning and finally the regulating services (Figure 2).

Thus fish is the most mentioned ESS mentioned by just about all the scientists present. This is followed by the supporting service of biodiversity gas and climate regulating services and spirituality. The supporting services of habitat and recreation are mentioned by just less than half of the participants while the remaining services are mentioned by substantially fewer.  Figure 3. Number of scientists that identified different specific services (colors reflect the four Millennium Ecosystem Assessment service types in Figure 2). The percentage of the respondents agreeing to the presence of different ESS is summarized in Table 1. Here we observe that with the exception of fish and the supporting service of biodiversity less than 50% of the respondents agreed to the presence of any ESS in the ocean area of their choice. And indeed for a number of services such as genetic resources chemical compounds waste disposal sites spirituality and resilience less than 10 % agreed to their presence in the case study areas in DiscardLess. We do however note that the respondents suggested a number of other services not mentioned in the presentation held before the respondents were asked to fill in the questionnaire especially as regards cultural services.

Thus there may be some variations in the probability of identifying some specific services dependent on what kind of academic background one may have. All have unsurprisingly a large probability of identifying the provisioning service of fish while the ecologists are substantially more prone to identify the supporting services of biodiversity than the other two groups. Fisheries biologists are much more likely to identify the supporting service of habitats and the cultural services of natural heritage and tourism but the least likely to identify recreation. Interestingly the Other group was most likely to identify primary production. This is most likely reflecting the diversity of the participants in this group.     doi: 10.5281/zenodo.1238588 www.discardless.eu 41/60  This project has received funding from the European Union�s Horizon 2020 Framework Programme for Research and Innovation under grant agreement no. 633680   Figure 4. Probability of different groups identifying the presence of specific ecosystem services in the ocean. The group Others includes social scientists economists and other participants. Identification of ESSs is one thing but the perceived importance of services is another. Thus fish is perceived to be the most important service followed by biodiversity (Figure 5). Many respondents believe primary production and habitats to have large importance but when summing the two higher importance levels we see that natural heritage surpasses these two.  Figure 5.

Though there is quite a spread of perceptions regarding how fisheries and the discard ban/landing obligation affect specific ESSs most respondents see the fishery as having a negative impact on the provisioning of fish while the discard ban/landing obligation has a somewhat positive effect (Figure 6).  Figure 6. How the provisioning service of fish is affected by fisheries and the discard ban/landing obligation. The y-axis presents the number of participants in each category. The different scientist groups� perception of whether fisheries have a negative effect and the discard ban/landing obligation has a positive effect on fisheries is summarized in Figure 7. Thus fisheries biologists will most probably identify fisheries as negatively impacting the provisioning of fish.

Probability of different participants perceiving there to negative effects of fisheries and positive effects of the discard ban/landing obligation on the provisioning of fish. Ecosystem services and disservices in which fisheries SECAS are embedded and how they might be affected by the discard ban / landing obligation Fisheries SECAS are embedded in a variety of services provided by ecosystems (Armstrong et al. 2012; Liquete et al. 2013) communities and species such as fish populations (Holmlund and Hammer 1999; Lynch et al. 2016) marine biodiversity (Beaumont et al. 2007) or waterbirds (Green and Elmberg 2014) but also disservices. The flow of all these services (and disservices) can be potentially affected by any management measure that modifies the collective behavior of fish and humans (i.e. the main agents in this SECAS) and the emergent properties of the fisheries SECAS as these behaviors and properties feed back influencing the environment in which the SECAS is embedded. Through a literature review we have identified and characterized the most important ESSs and ESDs in which fisheries SECAS are embedded (Table 2). Using the data from the DiscardLess 2016 survey and theoretical reasoning (Harman 2009) we have mapped the ESSs / ESDs that may be affected by the discard policy / landing obligation (Table 2). The effects of the landing obligation should be read with caution as the results presented in this study are based only on the perception about the topic of the DiscadLess 2016 survey participants and of the authors of the study and not on empirical research.

Thus the supporting services were more known to the respondents followed (in descending order) by the provisioning services cultural services and regulating services. However when reflecting over these results one has to also take into considerations those reported in Table 1: with the exception of fish and the supporting service of biodiversity less than 50% of the respondents agreed to the presence of any ESS in the ocean area of their choice. And indeed for a number of services such as genetic resources chemical compounds waste disposal sites spirituality and resilience less than 10 % agreed to their presence in the case study areas in DiscardLess.

However it seems that a large majority could be especially the cultural services. Note also that our list of services is most likely far from exhaustive making it possible that the LO may potentially have a much larger impact. Table 4. Total number of ESSs and disservices in which fisheries SECAS are embedded and how many of these might be affected by the discard ban / landing obligation.

Clearly the provisioning service of fish provided by some fisheries may result in impacts on for instance habitats  where bottom trawling is the classical example (Watling and Norse 1998). Marine habitats have been shown to hold values for the general public something we observe in the large push to conserve vulnerable marine environments (VMEs) and other marine habitats (Armstrong et al. 2014). Hence the provisioning services of fish are traded off against cultural and supporting services of habitat where such habitats are not protected or where for instance fisheries that impact benthos are not regulated. Indeed the fisheries effects on habitats may even feedback on the fisheries themselves as some habitats impacted by fisheries may also be important for the growth and density of harvested fish (Foley et al. 2012; Foley et al. 2010). Trade-offs may also occur in relation to policies implemented. For instance an LO may potentially reduce the provisioning of fish in that the regulation may make some fisheries become more costly and hence less lucrative. At the same time the LO may encourage changed behavior in order to reduce bycatch and thereby increase the cultural services emanating from the existence of fish and ocean habitats. In a similar vein of thought it would be interesting to repeat the exercise of crossing     doi: 10.5281/zenodo.1238588 www.discardless.eu 51/60  This project has received funding from the European Union�s Horizon 2020 Framework Programme for Research and Innovation under grant agreement no. 633680 ESSs / ESDs with any other management objective proposed by the Common Fisheries Policy or the Marine Strategy Framework Directive and afterwards analyze the ESSs / ESDs found at the intersection between the effects of the landing obligation and the effects of the other management objective. It would be interesting to have the possibility of adding a specific value (even if approximate) to each ESS / ESD included in Table 2 and thus to the effect of the respective management approach. However this is not an easy task. The measurement of provisioning ESS of fish is well developed and market oriented applying metrics such as weight value or employment depending on what type of values one is interested in. ESDs in the sense that they reduce provisioning ESS are measureable in the same fashion. The measurement of regulating cultural and supporting services is more complex. The valuation of supporting services is especially demanding as the value is already included in the final services be they provisioning ESSs regulating ESSs or cultural ESSs. As has been suggested supporting services are highly important to identify as impacts on their supply feeds into the final direct services but their monetary valuation may be less relevant (Armstrong et al. 2014). Values connected to regulating ESSs and cultural ESSs are less easily come by (Garcia Rodrigues et al. 2017). We leave this possible valuation exercise to future research. The ESSs frameworks are usually applied to identify or categorize the services that ecosystems provide (MEA 2005; CICES 2013). The frameworks also provide an overview that can be used to identify tradeoffs between services especially in the face of policies implemented. The LO focuses on regulated commercial species i.e. stocks that are managed with quotas or species with minimum conservation reference size (MCRS) regulations. The background for the push to limit discards can however be perceived to be more encompassing than purely in relation to commercially interesting fish. Studies show the public have a broader set of values in relation to fish than solely through what enters their stomach. Indeed people have non-use values connected to fish and their habitats in the sense that they value their existence without reference to own consumption (Aanesen et al. 2015). Hence the public reaction to waste in relation to discards can be seen to be deeper than purely the throwing overboard of edible fish. It relates to the wasteful killing of fish or other organisms that supply value either indirectly as habitat for fish or directly as cultural services providing existence values from fish or habitats. Indeed option values i.e. the valuation of potential future forgone services that we may not have full knowledge of today are also relevant for the ocean and have been identified to be something people put value on (Jobstvogt et al. 2014). However the LO may also lead to ESSs losses in the sense that previous discarding provided feed for birds and other organisms in the sea that have value potentially also storing carbon that now upon bringing to land increases global carbon emissions. In a broader governance setting these trade-offs are important not only due to the potential costs or benefits but also in relation to who gains and who loses. The legitimacy of management options in a governance perspective is often dependent on both the assessment of gains and losses and whether the outcomes of the process are deemed acceptable. Hence the background for the LO i.e. the general public�s perception of waste in fisheries that the previous EU discard rule produced may be substantially broader than purely in relation to commercial species. In this context focusing solely on impacts for commercial species does not fully identify the benefits and gains of the LO. In this study we have attempted to more broadly identify some of     doi: 10.5281/zenodo.1238588 www.discardless.eu 52/60  This project has received funding from the European Union�s Horizon 2020 Framework Programme for Research and Innovation under grant agreement no. 633680 the many ESS in the ocean areas of the LO how they are affected by the fishery and how the LO may impact on them. Using the ESSs framework expands the view of the services provided from the ocean and opens up for the LO having much broader effects than would otherwise be apparent when focusing purely on commercial values. Conclusions Fisheries are socio-ecological complex adaptive systems embeded in various ecosystem services and disservices. Thinking about fisheries in terms of the services that can be affected by the management decisions governing the fisheries SECAS could be a useful approach that can potentially generate innovative ways to approach fisheries governance issues. This understanding can enrich the discussions around the necessity to alter or even discontinue the human activity that affects or is affected by the services facilitating comparisons of management alternatives. Building on a non-exhaustive conceptual description of ESSs and ESDs and the preliminary results of a survey about the perception of these services implemented during the 2016 annual meeting of the DiscardLess project this study: 1. identified and characterizes the most important ecosystem services and disservices in which fisheries SECAS are embedded; and 2. mapped the services / disservices that may be affected by the discard policy / landing obligation. Considering these objectives we used the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA) ) in our discussion of fisheries. This framework includes supporting services that feed into the direct services to humans the provisioning regulating and cultural services. Employing this MEA framework we have identified 39 ESSs and 17 disservices in which fisheries SECAS are embedded. The participants identified some of these ESSs but for the most part they identified provisioning services of fish and the supporting services of biodiversity and habitat. A vast majority of these can be expected to be affected by the discard ban / landing obligation even though it is not clear in which way as can be interpreted from the responses to the survey. As further exploration tracks it would be interesting to repeat the exercise of crossing ESSs / ESDs with any other management objective proposed by the Common Fisheries Policy or the Marine Strategy Framework Directive and afterwards analyze the ESSs / disservices found at the intersection between the effects of landing obligation and the effects of the other management objective. Sometimes the degradation of an ecosystem can be attributed to the habit of seeing every ecological debate as a contest between biodiversity and socio-economic benefit where the resulting compromise decisions diminish ecosystem health (Pittock Cork and Maynard 2012). Using this framework to identify a greater diversity of ecosystem services and management options could help stakeholders engage in richer debates and could help institutions choose actions to provide a broader range of benefits for people (Pittock Cork and Maynard 2012). When an ecosystem-service perspective is used for setting objectives in aquatic habitat conservation speciality literature from the ecosystem services domain recommends following the next actions: 1. explicitly list and evaluate full suites of ESSs; 2. identify current and future potential trade-offs; 3. specify time frames within which particular strategies might protect or enhance desired services; 4. predict how different proposed strategies might affect each ESS (Boulton Ekebom and G�slason 2016). This study links with actions 1 and 4. Using the ESSs framework to analyze a fishery regulation such as the European Union (EU) Landing Obligation     doi: 10.5281/zenodo.1238588 www.discardless.eu 53/60  This project has received funding from the European Union�s Horizon 2020 Framework Programme for Research and Innovation under grant agreement no. 633680 (LO) (European Commission 2018) enables a richer and more encompassing view of the benefits and costs emanating from this policy change.

2018 SANTOS BORIT VANHEE modelling_the_captains_nose.pdf,Modelling the �captain�s nose�: Exploring the shift towards autonomous fishing with social simulation Jorge Santos1 Melania Borit13 and Lo??s Vanhe?e2 1 UiT (University of Troms�) - The Arctic University of Norway Norway 2 GREYC University of Caen France 3 Corresponding author: melania.borit@uit.no Abstract. With the rapid advances in the development of autonomous vehicles the fishing industry might be faced in the near future with a shift to (partially or totally) autonomous fishing vessels or operations. Large scale utilization of autonomous fishing practices will lead to a reorganisation of society in many respects with critical challenges related to conservation economy governance and ethics. This study focuses on some relevant topics to reflect on with social simulation approaches. These topics will have to be revisited when exploring the possible challenges and opportunities of moving from traditional to autonomous fishing activities. Keywords: Fishing industry; Human-agent interaction; Interdisciplinary approaches; Maritime robotics; Multi-agent systems; Social modelling 1 Introduction Even though partially or totally autonomous vehicles are present-day technology in several land based or marine transport modes (e.g. [3 5 17 35]) and are also explored as a possibility for maritime operations (e.g. [12 27 28 31]) for various reasons notably cultural [26] the domain of fishing has never been explored until now from this perspective. Fishing can be defined as any activity that involves the catching taking or harvesting of fish [13] and it basically involves the existence of a prey (i.e. the fish) and of an operator (i.e. the fisher) who uses some form of fishing gear. At sea fishing operations are typically supported by specialized vessels. Fishing is the core activity of fisheries which is a concept analysed lately from the perspective of socio-ecological complex adaptive systems [21]. Regardless of the challenges of sustainable fisheries management [7] fish is one of the most traded food commodities in the world [10]. By among others increasing human safety providing access to remote or difficult areas (e.g. rough weather spots deep sea) or decreasing costs associated with ship size moving towards autonomous fisheries might be seen as beneficial especially in fisheries targeting valuable species where envisaged profits might just push new 2 J. Santos M. Borit L. Vanhe?e technology through the cultural barriers mentioned by [26]. The future of such autonomous fishing (AF) operations can be easily imagined from a technical point of view with multi-agent approaches called in to address the difficulties rising from transforming a classic fishing vessel into a partially or fully AF vessel operating alone or together with supporting marine autonomous vehicles (underwater surface or aerial vehicles) in an AF operation system (AFOS) [37]. However many of the challenges of the transition from traditional fishing to AF stem from the dynamics of social interaction and the fine mechanisms of social processes and thus can be explored using social simulation (SocSim) approaches. Without focusing on a specific type of fisheries we analyse here several classic SocSim topics that we consider immediately relevant. 2 Historical background and a look into the future The history of fisheries in the 20th century shows that technology adoption in this domain was quick but that it took different paths in different ecosystems. For some of the new technologies the fishing industry was not only an early taker but also a strong pressure group for their consolidation (e.g. differential GPS). All the technology build-up (e.g. gradual adoption of radars echosounders sonars GPS) combined with deficient regulations or policies had the downside of the large increase in industrial fishing power [30] with a corresponding dwindling of many important fish stocks. The increased regulation of the last 30 years has led to the decommission of many old vessels (and fishers) which have often been replaced by fewer but larger vessels. This up-scaling is also an innovation with comprehensive changes in labour relationships financial organization processing and marketing. It became soon clearer that technology was replacing tradition skill and human intuition (the famous �captain�s nose� [6]): in modern fishing it is not the skipper�s skill and gut feeling but more the size of the boat and experience of the crew that contribute most to fisher�s success [25]. With the advent of autonomous vehicles in many other related areas the fisheries system might be facing a revolution with far reaching environmental and social consequences. Despite social and technological developments fisheries are still and will be very diverse activities owing to the different ecological and geographical settings. The new type of AF will be increasingly embedded with marine aquaculture but also with all other social and economic activities happening at sea and on land with technology augmenting the capacity of humans to deliver niche products. The use of this new technology might lead to setting the ground for a renaissance of clusters along the coasts a vision that is more related to peer-to-peer economy and a decentralized regional territoriality [14] (though the opposite might also happen with stocks being exploited by supra-national fishing conglomerates). Title Suppressed Due to Excessive Length 3 3 Topics to be revisited Technological shifts and acceptance of new technology. Innovation and acceptance of new technology depend on the cultural context (e.g. kinship) the markets and value chains under which fishers operate the age of the operators and their long-term commitment to the fishery as well as the regulatory environment [1 22 33]. For thousands of years fisheries were dominated by seasonal activities where traditional knowledge and kin relations in coastal communities played a central role. Early in the industrialization of fisheries by the 1930�s fishing operators still possessed a general all round set of skills and knowledge which were passed on within families and communities but they were being embedded in a new technological and institutional complexity. By the year 2000 in the industrial countries and increasingly around the world the main activity of a fisher is to run a business control finances and investments and understand fishing legislation [18]. The fishing knowledge itself is more embedded in technology systems and organizations and the important roles of kin have been replaced by technical education and often imported labor. Technological innovation and adoption goes hand in hand with the development of new processing technology and markets as well as institutional innovation (e.g. cooperatives mutuals or other forms of future governance). There is clearly a pressing need to understand the cultural and social relations that will hinder allow or favor the adoption of new technology and (full) autonomy in the different fisheries and ecosystem settings. SocSim offers a strong approach for evaluating the consequences of this technological transition on societies [23] and previous research in areas such as social norms social influence values/culture trust social psychology reputation social networks will play an important role here (e.g. (e.g. [9 24 34]). Moreover serious gaming and participative modelling could facilitate this transition [4]. Resource exploitation. In future fisheries production might be more demanddriven (probably for top-quality live fish) and autonomous agents will have to take decisions as to how and when to search for fish (i.e. prey). Once a patch of prey is encountered decisions will have to be made as to how long to stay there before moving on. Predator-prey models have a long history in ecology and have been amply dealt with in Individual-Based Modelling [16]. This includes dealing with the typical patch decision models that play an important role in the optimal foraging theory [8]. Like any other predator automated agents will have to compound the benefits and costs including opportunity costs of staying or leaving a patch as well as of cooperating with other agents in a competitive market economy. Differently from traditional resource exploitation models the agents must deal or learn to deal with different types of prey regulations variable order flows information sharing and new governance structures. This socio-ecological complex adaptive system of fisheries constitutes a relevant opportunity for establishing new agent-based models which can be applied for predicting the relevance of combinations of agents policies and institutional structures. 4 J. Santos M. Borit L. Vanhe?e Governance. AFOSs will include multiple sensors and nearly perfect knowledge of their local environment (e.g. schools of prey). It will be important to match production capacity of a legion of competing AFOSs spread over a large area to the stock size and productivity of the whole prey stock. Owing to the efficiency of autonomous agents as predators the information and (backward) control flows must happen in real time to ensure sustainability. This raises issues about the veracity and asymmetry of the information shared in the network as well as trust and maintenance of trade secrets (commercial advantages) within competing firms. Should networks be controlled by a principal (the government) multiple principals (agencies) or delegated to trusted agents or to peer-to-peer mechanisms? Application of design thinking to the study and development of optimal governance structures is a relatively recent field and SocSim is a promising approach to experiment and compare these different control regimes [19]. Value chains/network. AF will in principle be less constrained by time or weather limitations. This could be suitable for establishment of small supplier firms and for the production and trade of life fish and top quality products. This translates into better welfare for the fish and a superior market for the supplier. In a globalized world there is less competition between individual actors than between value-chains. These chains tend to become shorter and demand-driven. The configuration of the chains type of product and markets will dictate whether these chains will be dynamic or stable and this can be explored by SocSim [2]. It is relevant to analyse in which conditions vertical integration marketing and private certification schemes strategic alliances or horizontal arrangements such as cooperatives peer-to-peer networking or other hybrid models will be most suitable. Previous SocSim research in areas such as negotiations coordination cooperation reputation social networks or learning will be highly relevant here (e.g. [11 32 36]). Values/morals/ethics. Stakeholders and consumers are increasingly conscious of other values than just business or social economics (such as social responsibility animal welfare or valuing nature for its own sake). Simulations on AFOSs supply chains should go further and highlight new dividing issues some of which might have unexpected features. How long should the fish be kept alive after capture and before final consumption to ensure freshness and value but avoid prolonged stress? Should AF only target the highly valued species for the rich consumer markets? What balance of opportunities do we want between large-scale industrial and small-scale community fisheries? Modelling. Focusing SocSim efforts on this complex physical social and technological system in transition could contribute to learning how to make better models. From this perspective one key challenge would be eliciting the necessary (and many times implicit) information from the fishers in order to: 1. program the AFOS and its interaction with humans; 2. program the SocSim models needed to explore the topics mentioned above. Participatory modelling (e.g. [20]) and efforts towards devising methodologies for using qualitative data for informing agent rules (e.g. [15]) would play a crucial role here. Title Suppressed Due to Excessive Length 5 4 Conclusion The transition to AF both depends on and is consequential on society as a whole. Thus designing social simulations could be a useful tool for a variety of purposes from making decisions about for example policies or investments to exploring the consequences on society and organisations of the evolution of fishing techniques and fishing activities towards autonomy. Such endeavours might need better social theories and data [29]. Nevertheless they could also contribute to formulating new theories and uncovering undesirable outcomes and promising futures.

Theoretical�framework� 4.1. Traceability�and�traceability�systems� 4.1.1.� Traceability�concept�terms�and�definitions� The� following� constitutes� a� short� but� by� no�means� exhaustive� primer� on� traceability� terms� and� concepts.�For�some�of�these�terms�there�are�conflicting�or�ambiguous�views�or�definitions;�an�attempt� has�been�made�by�the�authors�to�choose�the�definitions�that�are�most�consistent�with�normal�practice� in�the�seafood�industry�as�well�as�the�most�suitable�term�for�the�gap�analysis.� 4.1.1.1.�Batch� A�common�dictionary�definition�of�batch�(or�lot)�is��the�quantity�of�material�prepared�or�required�for� one�operation�� [5].� In� seafood� supply� chains�we� commonly� refer� to� raw�material�batches� (the� fish� component)�ingredient�batches�(other�components)�and�production�batches.�Batch�is�an�internal�term� for�a�given� company;�batch� identifiers�are�often� locally�generated�within� the� company�and�do�not� normally�adhere�to�any�standards.�Batches�are�not�necessarily�explicitly�labelled�or�identified�within�the� company�as�long�as�the�company�knows�what�constitutes�a�given�batch.�See�Figure�3.� 4.1.1.2.�Trade�Unit� Trade�Unit�(or�Trade�Item)�(TU)�is�a�quantity�of�material�(e.g.�fish�product)�that�is�sold�by�one�trading� partner�to�another�trading�partner.�Incoming�trade�units�are�often�merged�or�mixed�into�raw�material� or� ingredient� batches� e.g.� when� captured� fish� are� sorted� by� size� and� quality� before� processing.� Production�batches�are�typically� large�(everything�produced�of�one�product�type� in�one�unit�of�time� typically� a� day� or� a� shift� is� common� practice� for� production� batches)� and� are� normally� split� into� numerous� outgoing� trade� units.� Trade� units� have� to� be� explicitly� labelled� and� identified� by� the� producing/�selling�company�so�that�the�receiving�/�buying�company�can�identify�the�content.�It�is�not� uncommon�for�trade�units�to�be�identified�by�the�(production)�batch�number�they�belong�to.�This�makes� traceability�more�difficult�and� less�effective�as�numerous� trade�units�will�have� the� same� identifier.� Unique� identification� of� trade� units� requires�more�work� but� it�makes� traceability� easier� and� it� is� becoming�more�common�in�companies�with�effective�traceability�systems.�See�Figure�3.� � Figure�3.�Example�of�batches�and�trade�units�in�the�supply�chain�of�a�company�[6].� � 11� 4.1.1.3.�Traceable�Resource�Unit�(TRU)� Traceable�Resource�Unit� (TRU)� is� �the�unit� that� the� company�wants� to� trace��or� �the�unit� that� the� company�records�information�on�in�the�traceability�system�.�In�this�document�TRU�can�be�taken�as�a� common�term�for�all�types�of�batches�and�trade�units.� 4.1.1.4.�Granularity� Granularity�depends�on�the�physical�size�of�the�TRU;�the�smaller�the�TRU�the�smaller�the�granularity.� When�implementing�a�traceability�system�companies�have�to�make�a�decision�on�the�granularity�they� want.�A� fish�processing� company� can� typically�choose�whether� they�assign�a�new�production�batch� number�every�day�every�shift�(e.g.�2?3�times�per�day)�or�every�time�they�change�raw�materials�(e.g.�1? 20� times�per�day).�The� lower� the�granularity� the�more�TRUs� they�will�have� the�more�work�will�be� involved� and� the�more� accurate� the� traceability� system�will� be.� Granularity� can� be� a� particularly� important�consideration�when�planning�for�potential�product�recalls;�the�larger�the�granularity�the�more� products�will�have�to�be�recalled�if�anything�goes�wrong.� 4.1.1.5.�TRU�identifiers�and�uniqueness�� TRUs�are�given� identifiers� in�the�form�of�numeric�or�alphanumeric�codes.�These� identifiers�are�either� assigned�by�the�company�that�generates�the�TRU�or�they�are�mutually�agreed�between�trading�partners� often�with�reference�to�standards.�The�identifiers�must�be�unique�in�their�context�so�that�there�is�no�risk� of�the�same�identifier�accidently�being�assigned�twice.�Ensuring�uniqueness�internally�in�a�company�is� not�too�difficult;�most�companies�have�defined�some�coding�schemes�(normally�used�on�batches)�that� ensures�that�within�that�company�the�same�identifier�is�not�used�twice.�Ensuring�uniqueness�when�many� trading�partners�are�involved�(typically�for�trade�units)�is�more�difficult�and�often�the�most�convenient� solution� is� to� use� globally� unique� identifiers� often� constructed� by� combining� country� codes� with� company�codes�that�are�unique�within�the�country�in�question�and�using�this�number�as�a�prefix�for�the� company?specific�codes.� 4.1.1.6.�Referential�integrity� The�TRU�identifier�must�be�unique�within�its�context�however�practice�differs�in�relation�to�whether� this�unique�identifier�can�only�be�assigned�to�one�TRU�or�whether�the�same�unique�identifier�can�be� applied�to�multiple�TRUs.�The�first�practice�is�referred�to�as��referential�integrity��or�the�licence�plate� (or�person�number)�principle.�If�referential�integrity�is�present�then�each�TRU�will�have�its�own�unique� identifier�not� to�be� shared�with�any�other�TRUs.� If� referential� integrity� is�absent� this�will� limit� the� effectiveness�of�the�traceability�system.�For�example�even�if�the�identifier��B12345��is�unique�in�a�given� context�and�has�a�number�of�properties�associated�with�it�(e.g.�vessel�name�catch�date�production�date� etc.)�referential�integrity�is�lost�if�that�same�identifier�is�used�for�more�than�one�TRU.�� While�all�these�TRUs�still�will�have�the�original�set�of�properties�in�common�(e.g.�they�all�come�from�the� same�vessel�and�were�caught�and�processed�on�the�same�dates)�it�is�not�possible�to�distinguish�between� TRUs�and�it�is�not�possible�to�record�further�properties�related�to�each�TRU�(e.g.�date/time�and�location� date/time�and�temperature�etc.).�It�is�not�uncommon�in�the�captured�fish�industry�to�use�the�internal� production�batch�number�as�identifier�for�each�trade�unit�that�is�generated�and�sold�but�this�does�not� provide� referential� integrity.�Traceability�systems� that�are�not�based�on� referential� integrity�may�be� simpler� (shorter� codes)�and� cheaper� (less�generation�of� codes� less� reading�of� codes)�but� they�will� inherently�suffer�from�the� limitations� indicated�and�there�will�be�numerous�potentially�relevant�TRU� properties�that�these�systems�can�never�keep�track�of.� � 12� 4.1.1.7.�Transformation� New�batches�and�new�trade�units�are�created�at�specific�times�typically�when�fish�is�caught�or�received� when�processes�generate�products�in�a�given�time�period�or�when�existing�TRUs�are�split�up�or�joined� together� (Figure� 4).� When� new� TRUs� are� generated� based� on� existing� ones� this� is� called� a� transformation;� typical� transformation� types� are� merges� splits� and� mixes.� To� document� a� transformation�one�needs� to�document�exactly�which�existing�batches�or� trade�units�were�used� to� create�a�new�batch�or�trade�unit;�often�it�is�also�relevant�to�record�the�amounts�or�percentages�used.� Often�trade�units�are�smaller�than�the�internal�batches�which�means�that�received�trade�units�are�often� joined� together� to�make� raw�material�batches.�A� typical� example�of� a� transformation� is�when� the� incoming�trade�unit�is��the�fish�of�a�given�type�bought�from�a�given�vessel�at�a�given�time��and�the�raw� material�batch� is��the� fish�of�a�given� type� (and�possibly�size)�used�as� raw�material�on�a�given�day�.� Another�typical�example�of�a�transformation�is�when�the�production�batch�is��everything�produced�of�a� certain�product�on�a�certain�day��and�the�outgoing�trade�unit�is��a�box�or�container�of�a�certain�weight� generated�from�that�production�batch�.� Figure�4.�Batches/trade�units�transformation�types�[6].� � � 4.1.1.8.�Traceability� There�are�numerous�definitions�of�traceability�most�of�them�recursive�in�that�they�define�traceability� as��the�ability� to� trace��without�defining�exactly�what��trace��means� in� this�context.�An�attempt� to� merge�the�best�parts�of�various�existing�definitions�while�avoiding�recursion�and�ambiguity�was�made� by�Olsen�and�Borit�[7]�who�defined�traceability�as��The�ability�to�access�any�or�all�information�relating� to� that� which� is� under� consideration� throughout� its� entire� life� cycle� by� means� of� recorded� identifications�.�This�emphasises�that�any�information�can�be�traced�that�traceability�applies�to�any�sort� of�object�or�item�in�any�part�of�the�life�cycle�and�that�recorded�identifications�need�to�be�involved.�The� latter�requirement�is�important�when�it�comes�to�differentiating�between�traceability�and�traceability� control�mechanisms;� i.e.�methods�and� instruments�that�measure�biochemical�properties�of�the�food� product� and� are� used� for� authentication� and� testing� whether� what� is� received� is� what� the� documentation�states;�see�Sections�4.1.6�and�4.1.7.� Traceability�depends�on�recording�all�transformations�in�the�supply�chain�explicitly�or�implicitly.�If�all� transformations�are�recorded�one�can�always�trace�back�or�forward�from�any�given�TRU�to�any�other� TRU� that�comes� from� (or�may�have�come� from)� the�same�origin�or�process.� In�addition� traceability� requires�relevant�information�to�be�recorded�and�associated�with�every�TRU�in�the�supply�chain�so�that� not�only�can�one�find�where�a�given�TRU�came�from�(the��ancestors�)�or�where�a�given�TRU�went�to� (�the�progeny�)�but�also�the�properties�within�these�TRUs�(when�and�where�was�it�created�weight�or� volume�what�form�is�it�in�what�species�fat�content�salt�content�etc.).� � 13� 4.1.1.9.�Internal�traceability� Internal�traceability�is�the�traceability�within�a�link�or�a�company�(Figure�5).�On�a�fishing�vessel�the�first� step� is� recording� information� related� to� the� catch;� in� the� other� links� the� first� step� is� recording� information�related�to�the�received�trade�units.�Subsequent�information�on�all�the�other�internal�steps� needs�to�be�recorded�including�all�transformations�that�take�place�and�all�relevant�properties�related� to� internally�generated�batches�or�trade�units.� Internal�traceability� is�the�backbone�of�traceability� in� general;�everything�else�depends�on�each�company�in�the�supply�chain�having�good�systems�and�good� practices�when�it�comes�to�recording�all�the�relevant�internal�information.�Internal�traceability�mainly� deals�with�batches�but�the�relationship�between�incoming�trade�units�and�raw�material�(or�ingredient)� batches�needs� to�be� recorded�and�also� the� relationship�between�production�batches�and�outgoing� trade� units.� Internal� traceability� is� the� domain� and� responsibility� of� a� single� company� data� confidentiality�or�access�is�not�a�big�issue�and�several�good�systems�solutions�practices�and�standards� have�been�developed�in�this�area.� 4.1.1.10.�Chain�traceability� Chain�traceability�is�the�traceability�between�links�and�companies�and�it�depends�on�the�data�recorded� in�the�internal�traceability�system�being�transmitted�and�then�read�and�understood�in�the�next�link�in� the�supply�chain�(Figure�5).�Data�can�be�transmitted�in�various�ways;�the�simplest�being�by�attaching�the� information�physically�(on�the�label)�or�logically�(in�accompanying�documentation)�to�the�product�when� it�is�sent.�A�more�flexible�way�of�implementing�supply�chain�traceability�is�for�trading�partners�to�agree� on�a�way�of� identifying�the�trade�units�and�then�to�send�the�required� information� through�another� channel�(fax�mail�electronically�integrated�systems)�while�referring�to�the�trade�unit�in�question.�This� is�commonly�referred�to�as��information�push�.�As�the�amount�of�data�grows�ever�larger��information� pull��has�also�gained�popularity�as�a�way�of�implementing�supply�chain�traceability.�Information�pull�is� when�the�trading�partners�agree�that�the�seller�should�retain�and�make�available�information�about�the� trade�unit�in�question�on�request.�It�could�be�a�request�submitted�by�telephone�or�fax�but�in�modern� electronic�systems�this�functionality� is�typically�accomplished�by�trading�partners�sharing�an� intranet� where�the�supplier�provides�detailed�data�on�all�trade�units�and�the�buyer�can�extract�whatever�data�is� needed.�Supply�chain�traceability�is�much�more�complex�to�achieve�because�it�requires�the�cooperation� and�agreement�between�at�least�two�companies�(in�practice�more�as�international�seafood�value�chains� are� complex)� and� data� confidentiality� and� levels� of� access� is� an� important� issue.� Supply� chain� traceability�is�often�closely�related�to�Electronic�Data�Interchange�(EDI)�which�in�turn�depends�heavily� on�the�agreement�on�and�adoption�of�standards�both�when�it�comes�to�media�identifiers�content�and� structure�of�the�data�that�are�to�be�exchanged.� � � � 14� Figure�5.�Internal�versus�chain�traceability�[6].� � � 4.1.2.� Traceability�systems� Traceability�systems�are�constructions�that�enable�traceability.�They�can�be�paper?based�but�more�and� more�commonly�they�are�computer?based.�Specialty�literature�contains�several�detailed�descriptions�of� traceability� systems� in�various� food� sectors�and� there� seems� to�be�a�general�agreement�over�what� properties�these�traceability�systems�could�or�should�have�[7]�[8]�regardless�of�whether�or�not�they�are� utilized�by�developed�or�developing�countries�large�or�small?scale�fisheries.� Specialty�literature�[7]�underlines�that�a�traceability�system�for�food�products�should�be�able�to:� a. provide� access� to� all� properties� of� a� food� product� not� only� those� that� can� be� verified� analytically;� b. provide�access�to�the�properties�of�a�food�product�or�ingredient�in�all�its�forms�in�all�the�links� in�the�supply�chain�not�only�on�production�batch�level;� c. facilitate�traceability�both�backwards�(where�did�the�food�product�come�from?)�and�forwards� (where�did�it�go?).� In�order�to�do�so�traceability�must�be�based�on�systematic�recordings�and�exchange�of�this�information.� There�are�many�relevant�properties�that�will�be�lost�if�there�is�no�record?keeping�system�and�a�way�of� distributing/sharing� the� information.� In� practice� this� means� that� a� unit� identification� system� or� numbering�scheme�must�be�present.�Without�a�unit�identification�system�one�cannot�achieve�several�of� the�goals�listed�above.� As�indicated�by�Olsen�and�Borit�[7]�for�this�to�happen�in�a�supply�chain�a�traceability�system�must�have� the�following�properties:� 1.�Ingredients�and�raw�materials�must�somehow�be�grouped�into�units�with�similar�properties� what�Moe�[9]�and�Kim�Fox�and�Gr�ninger�[10]�refer�to�as��traceable�resource�units�;� 2.�Identifiers/keys�must�be�assigned�to�these�units.�Ideally�these�identifiers�should�be�globally� unique�and�never�reused�but�in�practice�traceability�in�the�food�industry�depends�on�identifiers� that� are� only� unique� within� a� given� context� (typically� they� are� unique� for� a� given� day�s� � 15� production�of�a�given�product�type�for�a�given�company).�Expanding�on�this�issue�is�beyond�the� scope�of�this�paper;�see�Karlsen�Donnelly�and�Olsen�[11]�for�a�more�detailed�discussion�on�this;� 3.� Product� and� process� properties�must� be� recorded� and� either� directly� or� indirectly� (for� instance�through�a�time�stamp)�linked�to�these�identifiers;� 4.�A�mechanism�must�exist�to�get�access�to�these�properties.� Granularity�and�whether�to�have�referential�integrity�or�not�are�important�aspects�when�implementing� point�2�above�as�described�and�discussed� in�Sections�4.1.1.4���4.1.1.6.�The�recordings�mentioned� in� point�3�must�include�the�documentation�of�transformations�i.e.�the�recording�of�exactly�which�previous� TRUs�were�used�to�construct�the�current�TRU�(and�which�subsequent�TRUs�the�current�TRU�in�turn�will� became�a�part�of).�If�the�transformations�are�not�recorded�it�will�not�be�possible�to�track�the�TRU�along� the�entire�supply�chain�and�an� important�aspect�of�traceability� is� lost.�The�mechanism�mentioned� in� point�4�depends�on�whether�we�are�looking�at�a�company�or�the�supply�chain.�In�a�company�we�have� the�internal�traceability�system�often�software�with�ample�opportunity�for�browsing�data�visualizing� dependencies�(which�TRUs�were�based�on�which�TRUs)�and�creating�reports.�Even�though�there�are� best�practice�guidelines�for�traceability�[12]�getting�this�functionality�for�a�whole�supply�chain�is�a�major� challenge� and� probably� �the��major� challenge.� It� requires� effort�motivation� and� cooperation� in� addition�to�the�presence�of�technical�solutions�that�build�on�well?proven�and�widely�adopted�standards.� Verification� and� validation� of� the� data� recorded� by� the� traceability� system� is� of� course� also� very� important�(see�Sections�4.1.6�?�4.1.7)�but�these�are�external�processes�and�not�part�of�the�traceability� system�itself.�� 4.1.3.� Drivers�of�traceability�systems� Not� all� traceability� systems� are� equivalent� and/or� interchangeable� nor� can� they� necessarily� be�

Traceability�and�transparency� As� indicated� in� the� specialty� literature� and� directly� linked� to� building� trust� among� the� various� stakeholders� transparency� is�a� critical�element� in� risk� communication� [15]� [16].�Transparency�of�a� supply�chain� is�the�degree�of�shared�understanding�of�and�access�to�product?related� information�as� requested�by� a� supply� chain�s� stakeholders�without� loss�noise�delay�or�distortion� [15].�However� transparency�and�traceability�are�not�the�same�thing�because�the�latter�only�sets�the�framework�for�the� former� [17].�Depending�on�whether� transparency� is�aimed�at� the�past�present�or� future� it� can�be� divided�in�three�types:�history?�operations?�and�strategy�transparency�[15].�When�it�comes�to�products� it�can�be�said�that�traceability�can�enable�the�first�two�types�of�transparency�since�it�addresses�the�past� and�the�present�of�the�product�[18].�A�good�traceability�system�can�provide�product?related�information� to� stakeholders�with� little� loss�noise�or�delay�but�when� it� comes� to�distortion�we�have� to� remind� ourselves� that� a� traceability� system� basically� contains� mostly� unverified� claims� and� if� we� want� transparency�we�also�need�some�mechanisms�for�verifying�the�data�(see�Section�4.1.7).�� A� traceability� system� can� provide� a� coherent� overview� of� all� the� raw� materials� ingredients� transformations�processes� and�products� in� the� supply� chain.�One� cannot� really�have� transparency� without�traceability�but�for�transparency�some�other�components�are�needed�as�well.�This�is�related� to�the�fact�that�the�concept�of�traceability�is�quite�generic�and�could�be�summarized�as��keep�a�record� of�what�you�are�doing�in�the�supply�chain��whereas�transparency�has�a�specific�application�and�target� audience�in�mind.�One�measure�to�improve�transparency�is�to�establish�or�identify�authoritative�data� sources�including�a�global�record�of�fishing�vessels�[19].� 4.1.5.� Traceability�and�Chain�of�Custody� In�the�context�of�documenting�fish�products�FAO�defines�chain�of�custody�(CoC)�as:��The�set�of�measures� which� is�designed�to�guarantee�that�the�product�put�on�the�market�and�bearing�the�ecolabel� logo� is� really�a�product�coming�from�the�certified�fishery�concerned.�These�measures�should�thus�cover�both� the�tracking/traceability�of�the�product�all�along�the�processing�distribution�and�marketing�chain�as� well�as�the�proper�tracking�of�the�documentation�(and�control�of�the�quantity�concerned)��[20].This� means� that�while� traceability� and� CoC� to� some� degree� have� the� same� goal�well?documented� fish� products�their�approaches�are�quite�different.� Traceability�is�generic�and�non?discriminatory.�The�company�receives�trade�units�(or�fish�from�the�ocean� where�the�catch�is�identified�in�a�similar�way�as�a�trade�unit)�splits�joins�or�merges�trade�units�into�raw� material�batches�(e.g.�by�grading)�makes�production�batches�based�on�the�raw�material�batches�and� finally�splits�the�production�batches�into�outgoing�trade�units.�At�each�stage�a�spilt�join�or�merge�can� take� place� and� this� will� be� recorded� in� the� traceability� system� so� that� all� transformations� and� dependencies�are�documented.�The�golden�rule�in�a�traceability�system�is�that��you�can�do��anything�� as�far�as�the�traceability�system�is�concerned�but�you�must�document�what�you�are�doing�.� With�ecolabel?type�CoC�there�is�one�particular�set�of�properties�that�one�wants�to�protect�retain�and� document� (e.g.�ecolabels� such� as�dolphin?safe;�organic)�while�not� really� caring� about� the� rest.�The� ecolabel�in�question�will�normally�provide�the�list�of�required�values�for�the�properties�in�question�(e.g.� a� given� species� a� given� gear� type� a� given� area� or� fishery� documentation� of� various� aspects� of� sustainability�etc.)�and�also�assign� the�CoC� identifier.�This�CoC� identifier�applies� to�all� fish�products� produced�by�this�company�that�satisfy�the�given�set�of�properties.�This�may�include�fish�from�different� vessels�caught�on�different�days.�The�golden�rule�in�a�CoC�system�is�that��you�can�only�mix�units�that� have�the�same�CoC�number�and�if�you�do�so�the�CoC�number�is�retained�.� The�main�differences�between�traceability�and�CoC�are�summarized�in�Table�2.�In�theory�the�two�terms� might�mean�very�much�the�same�thing�but�in�practise�in�the�fish�industry�there�is�a�difference�between� traceability�and�ecolabel�type�chain�of�custody�[21]�as�outlined�above.� � 18�

of�what�is�required�for�certification�especially�certification�related�to�use�of�ecolabels.�� 4.1.6.� Traceability�and�catch/trade�documentation�schemes� The�definition�we�have�chosen�for�traceability�in�this�paper�is��The�ability�to�access�any�or�all�information� relating� to� that�which� is�under�consideration� throughout� its�entire� life�cycle�by�means�of� recorded� identifications�� [7].� There� are� numerous�mandatory� and� voluntary� catch� documentations� schemes� (CDSs)�in�use�around�the�world�and�while�they�have�properties�in�common�with�a�traceability�system� it�should�be�clear�that�they�do�not�in�themselves�constitute�traceability�systems.�CDSs�do�involve�some� very�relevant�recorded�identifications�but�the�set�of�recorded�data�is�limited�and�often�selected�for�one� purpose�only�(e.g.�customs�control�document�legal�provenance�of�captured�fish)�and�CDSs�do�not�apply� throughout�the�entire�life�cycle�of�the�product�in�question.�A�traceability�system�is��live��in�that�one�can� keep�adding�data�on�TRUs�as�long�as�they�exist;�a�CDS�provides�snapshots�of�a�subset�of�the�information� at�a�certain�time�and�place;�typically�when�first�hand�sale�is�conducted�or�when�the�product�passes�a� border.�This� is�not� to�say� that�CDSs�are�not� important� in� relation� to� traceability.�Firstly�an�efficient� traceability�system�will�to�a�large�degree�automate�the�generation�of�the�CDS�when�it�is�needed�which� means� that� time� and� effort� related� to� the� production� of� the� CDS� can� be� significantly� reduced� for� companies� with� efficient� traceability� systems� and� this� in� turn� provides� a� driver� for� investing� in� traceability.�Secondly�the�information�on�the�CDS�can�serve�as�input�to�traceability�systems�that�receive� the�product�in�question�and�the�data�there�will�be�in�a�standard�format�and�often�mandatory�which�in� turn�improves�the�quality�of�the�data�available�later�on�in�the�supply�chain.� 4.1.7. Traceability�and�analytical�methods� Currently�there�are�a�multitude�of�analytical�methods�and�instruments�in�use�to�measure�certain�physical� and�biochemical�properties�of� food�products�such�as�DNA� fingerprinting� [23]�spectroscopy� [24]�or� magnetic� resonance� [25].� The� first� thing� to� note� is� that� these� analytical�methods� do� not� provide� traceability.�Practically�all�definitions�of�traceability�including�the�one�chosen�in�this�document�indicate� that� traceability�must� entail� some� sort� of� historical� record� keeping.�While� analytical�methods� only� provide�instantaneous�measurements�it�is�of�course�true�that�some�of�these�measurements�can�provide� useful�and�relevant�information�about�the�product�and�process�history.�Most�of�the�data�in�a�traceability� system�can�be�considered�as�claims�and�most�of�these�claims�have�no�inherent�verification�connected� to�them�beyond�the�fact�that�someone�somewhere�in�the�supply�chain�once�entered�the�data�value�and� implicitly�claimed�it�to�be�a�true�property�of�the�TRU�in�question.�Unfortunately�false�claims�do�occur� both�because�of�errors�and�because�of�deliberate�fraud�often�for�economic�reasons.�Analytical�methods� are�essential�when� it� comes� to� verifying� (or� falsifying)� claims� in� traceability� systems�especially� if� a� dispute�or�a�court�case�is�involved�as�is�frequently�the�case�after�food�safety�incidents.�While�analytical� � 19� methods�can�be�very�useful� it� is�worth�noting�that�there�are�many�relevant�food�product�properties� that�cannot�be�analytically�verified�especially�in�the�capture�fish�industry.�These�include�properties�such� as� identity� of� food� business� operator� or� owner� at� various� stages� in� the� supply� chain� processing� conditions�that�did�not�directly�influence�the�food�properties�data�on�yield�and�economics�as�well�as� properties�relating�to�ethics�sustainability�and�legality�[7].�To�verify�claims�and�to�detect�fraud�in�these� areas�paper?trail�based�methods�are�needed.�The�most�common�methods�are�mass�balance�accounting� (i.e.�detection�of�unusual�claims�in�relation�to�yield�for�a�given�process)�and�input?output�analysis�(i.e.�a� mismatch�between�output�stated�in�one�place�and�corresponding�input�stated�another�place).�� 4.1.8. Traceability�and�data�validation�and�verification� Contrary� to�popular�belief� traceability� is�not�a�method� to�ensure� that� information�about�a� certain� product�is�true�or�accurate�[18].�Traceability�is�like�an�infrastructure�that�can�be�used�by�control�agencies� for�retrieving�different�data�for�various�reasons�(e.g.�quality�assurance)�or�for�verifying�these�data�with� their�specific�means�(e.g.�genetic�identification�of�species)�[26].�As�previously�mentioned�in�the�specialty� literature��a�traceability�system�is�quite�similar�to�a�filing�cabinet�in�that�they�both�deal�with�systematic� storing�and�retrieving�of�data.�Importantly�neither�a�traceability�system�nor�a�filing�cabinet�care�about� what� types�of�data�are�being�stored�� [7].�Error�and� fraud�can�make� the� recordings�either�untrue�or� incomplete.� Thus� the� need� to� verify� the� claims� becomes� obvious.� Together� with� comprehensive� inspections� and� certification� analytical�methods� (see� Section� 4.1.6)� play� an� important� role� in� this� respect�[27].� 4.2.� Harmonization�and�standardization�� Standards�are�closely�connected�to�supply�chain�traceability�because�supply�chain�traceability�requires� trading�partners�to�exchange�a� large�amount�of� information.�Unless�they�agree� in�great�detail�about� what�everything�means�and�how�it�should�be�structured�and�represented�information�loss�along�the� supply�chain�is�bound�to�happen.�For�two�trading�partners�to�make�their�own�specifications�about�the� information� interchange� would� make� little� sense� because� of� the� unnecessary� work� involved.� In� addition�they�both�are�likely�to�have�numerous�suppliers�and�customers�and�the�need�to�make�separate� agreements�with� all� of� them�would� not� be� feasible.� In� principle� the� internal� traceability�within� a� company� can� be� effective�without� resorting� to� standards� but� it� is� the� recordings� in� the� internal� traceability�system�that�provide�the�data�that�is�exchanged�in�the�supply�chain�traceability�system�and� it�is�there�that�the�data�needs�to�be�in�a�standard�format�if�the�trading�partner�is�to�understand�it.� To�support�the�data�interchanges�that�supply�chain�traceability�builds�on�standards�are�needed�on�many� levels:� ? TRU�identification.�As�indicated�in�Section�4.1.1.5���4.1.1.6�all�TRU�identifiers�need�to�be�unique� within�the�given�context�and�if�the�given�context�involves�several�companies�and�countries�the� best�way�to�ensure�uniqueness�is�to�use�an�internationally?agreed�upon�standard�for�generating� globally�unique�TRU�identifiers.�GS1�is�the�most�relevant�organization�for�unique�identifiers�on� global�level�in�general�but�there�are�also�other�alternatives.� ? Physical�media�for�codes�and�numbers�especially�on�labels.�Apart�from�the�obvious��clear�text�� option�there�are�among�others:�bar�codes�two�dimensional�bar�codes�QR?codes�and�radio? frequency�identification�(RF?ID)�tags�(active�and�passive).�The�trading�partners�need�to�agree�on� what�physical�media� to�use.�The� supplier�must�have�equipment� suitable� for�generating� this� media�type�and�the�buyer�must�have�equivalent�equipment�and�take�the�necessary�time�to�read� these�codes.�Internationally?agreed�upon�standards�exist�for�all�these�media�types�but�it�is�fair� to�say�that�uptake�of�the�more�advanced�technologies�(RF?ID�in�particular)�have�been�far�slower� than�anticipated.This�is�probably�due�to�cost�and�lack�of�motivation�in�large�parts�of�the�seafood� stakeholders.� ? Electronic�Data�Interchange�especially�based�on�various�types�of�eXtensible�Markup�Language� (XML)�messages.� Various� internationally?agreed� upon� standards� exist� and� use� of� these� is� increasing.�To�some�degree� this� is�driven�by� the�obligatory�use�of�similar�standards� in�some� � 20� business�situations� (e.g.�some�states�have�made�the�use�of�these�standards�obligatory�when� submitting�bids�for�government�contracts).� ? Data�element�names.�This�is�an�area�where�there�have�been�fewer�attempts�at�standardization.� ISO�12875�and�ISO�12877�are�among�the�exceptions.�Most�of�the�electronic�standards�are�based� on� XMLand� the� �eXtensible�� part� of� XML�means� that� XML� can� be� used� to� exchange� data� elements�that�have�not�been�pre?defined.�While�this�is�a�good�and�flexible�approach�it�does�not� really�facilitate�traceability.�When�data�is�recorded�somewhere�in�the�seafood�supply�chain�a� value�is�generated�(e.g.��198�)�often�a�unit�of�measurement�(e.g.��grams�)�and�these�attributes� are� then� associated�with� a� data� element� name� (e.g.� �weight�).� However� transmitting� the� information�that��weight�is�198�g��does�not�in�itself�facilitate�traceability.�The�recipient�needs� to�know�what�this�refers�to�the�weight�of�what�measured�how�when�and�where.�To�facilitate� efficient�and�error?free�communication�there�is�clearly�a�need�for�trading�partners�to�agree�on� what�the�data�element�names�should�be�and�exactly�what�they�should�refer�to.�This� is�what� standards� for�data�element�names�are�used� for.� Standards�are� like� commonly?agreed�upon� dictionaries� detailing� exactly�what� all� the� terms�mean� and� how� the� terms� are� interrelated� (�ontology��is�the�technical�term�for�this).� There�are�a�number�of�standards�on�these�levels.�Some�standards�are�for�products�in�general�some�for� food�products�and�some�for�seafood�in�particular.�In�addition�there�are�implicit�and�explicit�traceability� requirements�in�standards�and�in�regulation�where�traceability�is�not�the�main�focus�but�rather�food� quality� food�safety� food�processing�or�similar.� Ideally�one�can�argue� that� the�standards�should�be� merged�or�at�least�harmonized�but�in�practice�this�is�an�unrealistic�goal�precisely�because�the�scope�of� the�standards�varies�so�much.�Also�the�big�challenge�when�it�comes�to�implementing�traceability�is�not� the�fact�that�there�are�overlapping�or�conflicting�standards�and�that�conversions�are�needed�the�big� problem� is�the�fact�that�standards�are�not�used�(or�used�too� little)�when�designing�the�food� industry� systems�and�practices.� Among�the�measures�to�maintain�integrity�of�product�tracking�and�for�improving�standardization�there� are� [19]:� minimum� information� standards� for� wild?caught� fish� products� should� be� adopted;� establishment�of�a�harmonized�system�of��landing�authorizations��to�provide�primary�assurances�of�the� legal�origin�of�fish�products;�and�development�of�a�global�architecture�for�interoperability�systems.� 4.3.� Consistency�� From�a�norms�perspective�coherence�relates�to��positive�connections��or��the�construction�of�a�united� whole��while� consistency� refers� to� the� absence�of� contradiction� [28].� The� latter� refers� to� ideas�of� compatibility�and�of�making�good�sense�whereas�the�former�relates�more�to�synergy�and�added�value.� �Hence�coherence�in�law�would�be�a�matter�of�degree�whereas�consistency�would�be�a�static�notion�in� the�sense�that�concepts�of�law�can�be�more�or�less�coherent�but�cannot�be�more�or�less�consistent.�They� are�either�consistent�or�not��[28].�From�a�theoretical�point�of�view�the�meaning�of�norms�consistency� has�been�refined�as�horizontal�consistency�and�vertical�consistency.�The�latter�applies�for�example�to� the�relations�between�the�Member�States�and�the�European�Union�(EU)�while�the�former�focuses�on� implementation�and�refers�to�consistency�at�the�EU�level�either�inter?institutional�or�inter?policy�[29].� In� terms�of� this� second� aspect� consistency� can�be�defined� as� �the�way� in�which� the� substance�of� different�policies�generated�by�the�EU�forms�part�of�whole��[30].�Nevertheless�the�application�of�the� consistency�principle�has�to�be�flexible�enough�for�regulatory�approaches�to�change�due�to�changes�in� the�context�(e.g.�the�change� in�the�EU�regulatory�regime�for�food�as�a�consequence�of�the�mad�cow� disease�[31]).�Yet�another�important�aspect�is�that�norms�are�not�only�formulated�but�also�applied�in�a� consistent�manner�[32].� � � � 21� Building�on�these�aspects�this�traceability�gap�analysis�study�uses�the�following�concepts:� 1. Intra?institutional�regulatory�consistency�which�refers�to�the�different�norms�generated�by�the� same�institution�form�part�of�a�whole;�� 2. Inter?institutional� regulatory� consistency� which� refers� to� the� use� of� similar� concepts� and� procedures�for�related�items�by�different�entities�in�the�same�industry.�� 3. Application�consistency�which�refers�to�the�similar�application�of�the�same�norms.� One�important�consequence�of�the�lack�of�regulatory�inter?institutional�consistency�is�fragmentation� i.e.�the� increased�proliferation�of�standards�and�norms�with�overlapping� jurisdictions�and�ambiguous� boundaries.�This�can�lead�to�forum�shopping�[33]�confusion�among�industry�and�consumers�alike�[26]� and�delay� in�development�of� valuable�products� and� services� [34]� that� in�our� case� could� facilitate� implementation�of�seafood�traceability.�� � � � 22� 5.� Overview�of�existing�traceability�standards�and�regulations� Previous�analysis�of�seafood�traceability�practices�[1]�presented�to�the�COFI:FT� identified�three�main� categories� of� traceability� standards� and� regulations� that� this� study� deems� to� follow:� international� standards�and�guidelines�regulatory�standards�and� industry�and�NGO�non?regulatory�standards.� It� is� important�to�note�that�all�the�current�traceability�standards�refer�to�implementation�of�traceability�and� none�of�them�to�certification�of�already�implemented�traceability�systems.� 5.1.� International�standards�and�guidelines� Inter?governmental� guidelines� [1]:� International� standards� and� guidelines� are� developed� to� define� and/or�to�provide�best�practices�in�tracing�food�products�through�supply�chains.�This�category�includes� standards�and�guidelines�developed�by�the�Regional�Fisheries�Management�Organizations�(RFMOs)�and� other� natural� resource�management� inter?governmental� organizations� in� their� attempts� to� provide� guidance�to�their�member�states�in�dealing�with�illegal�unreported�and�unregulated�(IUU)�fishing.� 5.1.1.� Codex�Alimentarius� The�Codex�Alimentarius�or�"Food�Code"�was�established�by�FAO�and�the�World�Health�Organization�in� 1963�to�develop�harmonised�international�food�standards�which�protect�consumer�health�and�promote� fair�practices�in�food�trade�[35].�The�Codex�defines�traceability�as��the�ability�to�follow�the�movement� of�a� food� through� specified� stage(s)�of�production�processing�and�distribution�� [36].�This�definition� reduces�traceability�to�following�only�the�movement�of�food�products.�Codex�Alimentarius�is�recognized� by� the�World�Trade�Organization� as� an� international� reference�point� for� the� resolution�of�disputes� concerning� food� safety� and� consumer� protection� so� the� traceability� definition� there� is� of� special� importance�even�though�it�is�not�commonly�referred�to�at�least�not�in�scientific�articles�[7].�The�Codex� recognises�that�at�the�international�level�methods�are�not�harmonised�and�are�often�complicated�thus� leading� to� barriers� to� trade� [37].� The� approach� to� traceability� taken� by� the� Codex� is� considered� insufficient�by� the� specialty� literature�as� it�does�not� incorporate�essential�properties�of� traceability� systems�[7].� 5.1.2.� FAO�guidelines� 5.1.2.1.�Marine�capture�fisheries�?�ecolabelling� The�FAO�Guidelines�for�the�ecolabelling�of�fish�and�fishery�products�from�marine�capture�fisheries�[20]� summarise� several� principles� that� should� be� observed� by� seafood� certification� schemes.� These� Guidelines� cover� the� fishery� management� system� the� status� of� the� target� stock� and� ecosystem� considerations�within�the�overarching�purpose�of�identifying�sustainable�fisheries�[1].�Paragraph�16�of� the�Guidelines�state�that�the�chain�of�custody�measures�designed�by�the�certification�scheme��should� cover�both�the�tracking/traceability�of�the�product�all�along�the�processing�distribution�and�marketing� chain�as�well�as�the�proper�tracking�of�the�documentation�(and�control�of�the�quantity�concerned)�.� However�as�explained�in�Section�4.1.5�of�this�study�even�though�in�theory�the�two�terms�might�mean� very�much�the�same�thing�in�practise�in�the�seafood�industry�there�is�a�difference�between�traceability� and�ecolabel?type�chain�of�custody.� 5.1.2.2.��Aquaculture�?�certification� The� FAO� Technical� guidelines� on� aquaculture� certification� provide� guidance� for� the� development� organization�and� implementation�of�credible�aquaculture�certification� schemes� [38].�The�Guidelines� address� a� range� of� issues� that� should� be� considered� as� relevant� for� certification� in� aquaculture� including:�a)�animal�health�and�welfare;�b)�food�safety;�c)�environmental�integrity�and�d)�socio?economic� aspects�associated�with�aquaculture�[1].�The�Guidelines�state�that�one�of�the�principles�of�aquaculture� certification�schemes�is�that�they�should�include�adequate�procedures�for�maintaining�chain�of�custody� and�traceability�of�certified�aquaculture�products�and�processes.�� � 23� 5.1.3.� RFMO�catch/trade�documentation�schemes� RFMOs�are�international�organisations�formed�by�countries�with�fishing�interests�in�given�areas�beyond� national� jurisdiction� (ABNJs).�Some�RFMOs�manage�all� the� fish�stocks� found� in�a�specific�area�while� others�focus�on�particular�highly?migratory�species�notably�tuna�throughout�vast�geographical�areas.� While�some�RFMOs�have�a�purely�advisory�role�most�have�management�powers�to�set�catch�and�fishing�

covered�by�at�least�one�RFMO�out�of�the�18�currently�existing�Fisheries�Management�Bodies�[40].�Of� these� five�RFMOs� are� the� so?called� tuna�RFMOs�which�manage� fisheries� for� tuna� and�other� large� species�such�as�swordfish�and�marlin�[41].�As�part�of�their�fight�against�IUU�fishing�RFMOs�utilize�trade�

food� traceability�[44].�The�one�implemented�through�the�application�of�the�General�Food�Law�[45]�leads�to�a� generic�(nonspecific)� low?warranty�traceability�of�the�EU�food�supply�chain.�A�second�more�complex� model�is�followed�through�norms�regulating�products�such�as�those�derived�from�genetically�modified� organism.�The�application�of�this�second�model�leads�to�a�specific�high?warranty�traceability�system�for� any� product� unit� in� the� food� supply� chain.� In� general� the� EU� traceability� systems� are� considered� insufficient�[46].� According�to�the�text�of�Article�18�of�the�European�Commission�Regulation�178/2002�laying�down�the�

legal�requirements�rely�on�the��one�step�back�?�one�step�forward��approach�to�traceability.�This� approach� implies� that� food�business�operators�have� to�establish� two� types�of� links:�a� link��supplier? product�� (which� products� supplied� from� which� suppliers)� and� a� link� �customer?product�� (which� products�supplied�to�which�customers).�Nevertheless�operators�do�not�have�to�identify�the�immediate� customers�when�they�are�final�consumers.�The�Regulation�does�not�expressly�constrain�operators�to� establish�a� link��incoming�and�outgoing�products��(so�called��internal�traceability�).�Thus�there� is�no� requirement�for�records�to�be�kept� identifying�how�product�batches�are�split�and�combined�within�a� company�to�create�particular�products�or�new�batches�[47].�In�other�words�companies�have�to�know�

Gaps� Despite�the�many�tools�and�practices�for�seafood�traceability�approaches�remain�underdeveloped�and� fractured�across�geographies�jurisdictions�and�market�sectors�[55].�There�are�traceability?related�gaps� both�when�it�comes�to�awareness�commitment�implementation�technology�and�standards.�Based�on� the�authors��analysis�the�most�important�gaps�are�indicated�below.� Awareness�gaps:�� ? Lack�of�understanding�(both�at�government�and�private�sector�levels)�of�what�traceability�is�and� how�it�differs�from�other�concepts�that�are�viewed�to�be�similar�e.g.�chain�of�custody�or�trade�/� catch�documentation�schemes.� ? Lack�of�understanding�of�how�traceability�can�streamline�companies�internal�processes�and�thus� improve�financial�performance�[55].� ? Lack�of�understanding�(both�at�government�and�private�sector�levels)�of�the�fact�that�many�of�the� main�obstacles�for�adoption�of�traceability�in�seafood�supply�chains�are�cultural�and�organizational� rather�than�technical�[55].� ? Lack�of�understanding�(both�at�government�and�private�sector�levels)�of�the�fact�that�traceability� needs� to� cover� the� entire� seafood� supply� chains� from� catch� or� farming� through� all� types� of� processing�and�transport�all�the�way�to�the�retailer�and�the�consumer.�For�instance�for�fisheries� �the�gaps�in�the�system�occur�at�many�levels:�at�sea�where�monitoring�control�and�surveillance� remain�frequently�inadequate;�in�ports�where�systems�to�document�catch�landings�are�often�weak� or�non?transparent;�and�within�countries�where�effective�systems�to�require�traceability�and�proof� of�legal�origin�are�lacking�[56]�.�This�is�connected�to�the�lack�of�understanding�(both�at�government� and� private� sector� levels)� of� the� difference� between� internal� traceability� and� supply� chain� traceability.�While� the� first�may�be� effective� in� a� given� company� it� is� the� entire� supply� chain� traceability�that�really�matters�and�that� is�not�something�a�given�company�can�achieve�on�their� own.� ? Lack� of� understanding� (both� at� government� and� private� sector� levels)� of� the� importance� of� documenting�transformations�and�how�the�chain�of�transformations�is�essential�if�we�want�to�trace� backward�or�forward�to�or�through�companies.�This�is�connected�to�the�lack�of�understanding�(both� at�government�and�private�sector� levels)�of�the� importance�of�referential� integrity.�Namely� it� is� much� easier� to� document� and� visualize� the� chain� of� transformations� if� all� TRUs� have� unique� identifiers.� Commitment�gaps:� ? The�commitment�gap�when� it�comes�to� implementing�seafood�traceability�systems� is�significant� (both�at�government�and�private�sector�levels)�and�probably�related�to�the�many�awareness�gaps.� While�there�are�still�challenges�related�to�availability�of�technology�solutions�and�standards�it�is� clear� that�most� companies�have� less� traceability� than� they� could�have� and� also�probably� less� traceability�than�they�should�have�given�their�strategy�their�priorities�and�their�own�economic� interests.� In� addition� the� most� significant� commitment� gap� is� related� to� companies� not� understanding�how�traceability�can�benefit�them�financially.�There�is�increasing�documentation�of� the�fact�that�not�only�can�a�good�traceability�system�reduce�operating�costs�and�fulfill�legislative� and�commercial�requirements� it�can�also�underpin�company�branding�and�marketing�strategies� and�give�the�company�a�competitive�advantage.�Cost/benefit�analysis�of�investments�in�improved� traceability� systems� is�difficult� to�do�and�credible� conclusions� in� this�area�are� fragmented�and� anecdotal.�But�it�seems�clear�that�many�of�the�benefits�related�to�improved�traceability�were�not� anticipated�by� the� companies� in�question�before� the� investment.�Typically�companies� invest� in� traceability�because�they�have�to�either�to�fulfill�legislative�or�commercial�requirements�to�enter� target�markets�and�thus�are�surprised�to�learn�that�a�side?effect�of�the�investment�in�traceability� � 27� is� that� they� have� better� industrial� statistics� faster� turnover� of� ingredients� raw�materials� and� products�and�reduced�amount�of�goods�in�storage.�While�this�comes�as�good�news�it�means�that� many�companies� that�would�have� invested� in�better�traceability� if�they�knew�about� these�side? benefits�do�not�do�so.�This� is�an� important�explanation�behind�the� industry�s� lack�of�motivation� and�commitment�to�tracebility�systems.� Implementation�gaps:� ? There�is�the�gap�between�regulatory�requirements�and�the�feasibility�of�industry�implementation� [57].�At�the�EU�level�this�might�be�due�to�several�gaps�in�traceability�requirements�[58]�such�as:� lack�of� a� robust� fishery� control?based� catch� certificate� inadequate�document� security� for� split� consignments�and�insufficient�maintenance�of�batch�integrity�(here�referential�integrity�plays�an� important�role�[59]).� Technology�gap�[45]:� ? Lack�of�verification�procedures�that�integrate�with�monitoring�of�food�authenticity�[55].�This�lack� of�verification�procedures�means�that�it�may�be�possible�to�follow�a�product�back�and�forth�through� the�food�chain�and�yet�still�not�have�certainty�that�the�product� is�what� it�has�claimed�to�be.�For� example�IUU�fish�may�enter�the�chain�fraudulently�yet�once�in�the�seafood�supply�it�is�sufficiently� traced�along�the�chain.�� ? Lack� of� cheap� functional� and� robust� radio?frequency� identification� tags.� The� time� and� work� involved� in� reading� a� number� of� bar� codes� is� significant� whereas� RF?ID� tags� can� be� read� instantaneously�and�from�a�distance.�The�cost�of�reading�is�a�very�important�factor�which�to�some� degree�prevents�the�introduction�of�smaller�granularity�TRUs�and�in�particular�it�makes�it�expensive� to�implement�referential�integrity.�RF?ID�tags�inherently�provide�referential�integrity.�No�two�tags� ever� have� the� same� identifier� and� the� quality� of� the� traceability� system� will� be� significantly� improved�when�the�bulk�of�the�industry�adopts�RF?ID�tags�as�a�common�practice.� ? Lack�of�cheap�functional�and�robust�technologies�for�Automatic�Data�Capture.�A�significant�cost� related�to�the�running�of�a�traceability�system�is�the�cost�associated�with�initial�data�entry.�This�is� frequently� performed� manually.� If� technologies� existed� that� could� automatically� extract� the� relevant� data� enter� them� into� the� traceability� system� and� associate� them� with� the� TRU� in� question�this�would�simplify�and�speed�up�the�process�and�reduce�the�number�of�errors.�This�could� also�be�partly� an� implementation� gap.� To� some�degree� these� technologies� exist�but� they� are� underused�and�they�are�in�general�not�seamlessly�connected�to�the�traceability�system.� Standards�gaps:� ? This�analysis�of�traceability�standards�and�norms�revealed�a�series�of�inconsistencies�both�between� the�standards/norms�issued�by�the�same�institution�and�those�issued�by�different�institutions�but� referring�to�the�same�topic�(see�Section�6.2�for�details).�� ? Lack�of�uniform�requirements�or�standards�for�information?gathering�and�information?sharing�that� are�needed�for�effective�traceability�[46]�[55].�This�gap�to�some�degree�inhibits�interoperability� of�technology�systems�along�the�supply�chain�thereby� increasing�business�risks�and�costs�when� choosing�and�adopting�traceability�and�information�systems.� ? Lack�of�a��standardised� seafood�attribute?naming� list�.�Different�countries�often�have�different� �seafood�attribute� lists��and� the�use�of�standards� in� this�area� is�not�prevalent.�For� instance� in� different�countries�different�names�can�be�applied�to�the�same�species�or�the�same�name�can�be� applied�to�different�species�[60].� 6.2. Inconsistencies� 6.2.1.� Intra?institutional�inconsistency� When� it� comes� to�EU� specific� legislation� related� to� traceability� recent� research� considers� that� this� legislation�suffers�from�intra?institutional�inconsistency�as�different�norms�have�different�approaches� � 28� to� traceability� depending�mainly� on� the� drivers� of� these� norms.� Thus� when� the�main� driver� for� implementing�traceability�relates�to�or�can�impact�on�human�health�as�opposed�to�product�quality�or� environmental�sustainability� it�was� found� that�EU� legislation�normally� imposes�effective� traceability� systems�[26].�This�finding�is�similar�with�the�conclusion�that�can�be�inferred�from�the�analysis�performed� in� [1]� regarding� the� consistency� of� the� provisions� referring� to� data� capture� and� management� requirements�for�the�EU�GFL�and�EU�IUU�Regulation.�� The�same� type�of� inconsistency�can�be� inferred� from� [1]� in� the�case�of�FAO�Guidelines�described� in� Section� 5.1.3.� While� the� provisions� of� the� two� documents� are� the� same� for� data� capture� and� management� requirements� they� differ� for� unique� identification� requirements� and� are� opposite� regarding�data�communication�requirements.�� Intra?institutional�consistency�can�be�inferred�too�in�the�case�of�transition�from�ISO�8402�to�ISO�9000� and�22005�with�the�provisions�of�the�newer�standards�lacking�the�accuracy�of�the�older�one�[7].�� The�traceability�systems�proposed�by�Codex�Alimentarius�EU�GFL�and�ISO�8402�9000�and�22005�suffer� from�inter?institutional�inconsistency.�As�explained�in�the�specialty�literature�[7]�they�do�not�refer�to� traceability�in�the�same�way.�All�of�these�standards�and�norms�use�a�verb�phrase�that�is�either�recursive� (i.e.� traceability�means� to� trace)� or� vague� (i.e.� traceability�means� to� follow).� There� are� additional� problems�such�as:�not� identifying�exactly�what� the�TRUs�are� (Codex);�not� indicating�which�stages�of� production�should�be�covered�by�traceability�(ISO)�or�limiting�this�coverage�to�specific�stages�(Codex)� not� explaining� how� to� trace� (all� except� ISO� 8402)� and� not�mentioning�what� properties� should� be� recorded�by�the�traceability�system�(EU�GFL)�or�only�mentioning�one�property�(Codex).� The� same� inter?institutional� inconsistency� can� be� seen� in� the� three�main� categories� of� traceability� standards�and� regulations� that� this�study� follows:� international�standards�and�guidelines� regulatory� standards� and� industry� and� NGO� non?regulatory� standards.� As� indicated� in� [1]� the� provisions� of� international� standards� and� guidelines� vary� substantially� with� regards� to� unique� identification� requirements�and�data�communication�requirements�while�they�are�more�consistent�with�regards�to� data�management�and�capture�requirements.�The�provisions�of�the�EU�US�and�Japan�are�consistent� with� regards� to� data� communication� requirements� but� are� less� consistent�with� regards� to� unique� identification�and�data�capture�and�management�requirements.�The�provisions�of�the�non?regulatory� standards�with�regards�to�data�capture�and�management�are�consistent�among�documents�and�with� the� respective� ones� from� international� standards� and� guidelines� except� in� the� case� of� the� RFMO� documentation� schemes.� The� provisions� for� unique� identification� requirements� and� for� data� communication�requirements�vary�among�these�non?regulatory�standards.� � � � 29� 7.� Conclusions� This�report�was�tasked�with�analysing�gaps�and�inconsistencies�in�current�seafood�traceability�standards� and�regulations�and�to�generate�recommendations�based�on�those�findings.�Several�gaps� in�seafood� traceability� standards� and� norms� were� identified� by� employing� a�multi?method� analysis� namely:� awareness�commitment� implementation� technology�and�standards.� In�addition�specific� inter?�and� intra?institutional�inconsistencies�were�also�noted.�� � � � 30� 8.� Recommendations�� Recommendations�arising�from�this�traceability�gap�analysis�include�the�need�to:� ?

A Systematic Literature Review in a European Union Context Charlotte Teresa Weber* Melania Borit and Michaela Aschan Faculty of Biosciences Fisheries and Economics Norwegian College of Fishery Science UiT-The Arctic University of Norway Troms� Norway Fisheries are complex adaptive social-ecological systems (SES) that consist of interlinked human and ecosystems. They have mainly been studied by the natural sciences and focused on the ecosystem. However rising concerns about sustainability and increasing complexity of societal challenges often require an understanding of fisheries in a SES context. For this purpose the study of the human system should be expanded within fisheries science. Models are currently the most common method used in the field and these need to include the human dimension alongside the ecosystem when addressing fisheries systems as SES. The human dimension is an umbrella term for the complex web of human processes and it is captured by disciplines from the social sciences and the humanities. Consequently capturing and synthesizing the variety of disciplines involved in the human dimension and integrating them into fisheries models requires an interdisciplinary approach. This study attempts to assess the presence of the human dimension in fisheries models applied to a European Union context and to evaluate interdisciplinarity within modeled human dimension aspects through a systematic review and qualitative analysis. Within 31 modeling publications 20 different human dimension aspects could be identified within the categories of social phenomena social processes and individual attributes. Most of the human dimension aspects were modeled in an interdisciplinary manner in mathematical statistical simulation or conceptual models. Yet predominantly through the use of economic and environmental variables. We conclude that there is potential for the expansion of the human dimension and interdisciplinarity in fisheries models. To reach this potential one should consider early involvement of all relevant disciplines in the formulation of theories identification of data and in the model development. We provide recommendations for interdisciplinary model development communication and documentation to increase our understanding of fisheries as SES. Keywords: social science integration social model reproducibility model documentation Weber et al. Human Dimension in Fisheries Models INTRODUCTION Fisheries have been recognized as social-ecological systems (SES) that couple a human system with a natural one (Ostrom 2009). These two subsystems are connected and intertwined and have a two-way feedback relationship where a change in one of the subsystems can impact the other and vice-versa (Berkes 2011). SES also have the characteristics of complex adaptive systems such as non-linearity uncertainty and self-organization (Levin et al. 2012; Leenhardt et al. 2015). Thus fisheries can be understood as social-ecological complex adaptive systems. The field of fisheries science has been traditionally dominated by natural scientists (Link 2010). Their research efforts have focused mainly on topics relating to the natural subsystem (Syed et al. 2018). As a result the lack of consideration of the human subsystem has in some cases led to management and policy failures (Freire and Garcia-Allut 2000; �sterblom et al. 2011). Yet rising concerns about sustainability and the increasing complexity of societal challenges e.g. fisheries under climate change require an understanding of the interconnections of fisheries in a broader context (Starfield and Jarre 2011; Elsevier SciDev.Net 2015; Rissman and Gillon 2017; Marshall et al. 2018). Therefore to better understand and address such societal and sustainability concerns fisheries science will have to expand to a SES perspective by including considerations of the human subsystem alongside the natural one (Ostrom 2009; Hicks et al. 2016). Fisheries science commonly uses modeling approaches to assess and explore fisheries systems for knowledge production and to provide management advice. Models are the most commonly used method in this field (Jaric? et al. 2012). Models are a common way to integrate various data and additional considerations on for example theory or indicators (Link 2010 p. 89). Models can provide an inspiring point of departure and a guiding principle for interdisciplinarity (e.g. Heemskerk et al. 2003) and models have a high potential to be used as an integrative research method in itself. Consequently including considerations of the human subsystem into these models could provide a better understanding of fisheries as SES. However the human subsystem is not easily captured as it is a broad and diverse field of study. The umbrella term �human dimension� in relation to fisheries has been used in order to refer to the diversity within the human subsystem and to highlight its importance (OECD 2007; Charnley et al. 2017). The human dimension (HD) can be understood as a complex web of human processes that relate to natural resources (Spalding et al. 2017). It can be categorized into social phenomena social processes and individual attributes (Bennett et al. 2017). To study theHD human dimension aspects (HDA) (i.e. smaller components within an HD category) are often analyzed such as compliance or trust. Due to the diversity of the human subsystem the HD and its HDAs are addressed by many different disciplines ranging across the social sciences and the humanities (Bennett et al. 2017; Spalding et al. 2017). Fisheries models commonly use environmental fisheries and economic data because these data are available from surveys log-books landing- and sales statistics. Economic and environmental considerations are also very prominent in frameworks for a comprehensive approach to fisheries management (Stephenson et al. 2018). Consideration of the HD and the collection of HD data has been falling short and social data is often unavailable or lacking (Hatchard and Gray 2014). Social information is also more difficult to collect as social issues range from individual to global concerns (Bennett et al. 2017) additionally hindering the quantification of HDAs (Symes and Phillipson 2009; Hatchard and Gray 2014). In cases where social science data has been provided information is usually presented in the form of descriptive text which is often neither read nor integrated into fisheries assessments in a meaningful way (Hall-Arber et al. 2009). While the inclusion of HD in models is generally driven by the research question sustainability and societal challenges create a need for fisheries models to capture the HD and its diversity. Through multi- and interdisciplinary efforts the necessary support for the inclusion of the broad concept of HD can be provided. However it remains unclear to what extend the HD has been integrated into fisheries models and how interdisciplinary the field of HD in fisheries models is at present and into what areas and approaches it could be expanded. The aim of this study is to assess the presence of HD in fisheries models to evaluate interdisciplinarity within modeled HDAs and to explore the modeling approaches used to model different HDAs. These objectives were translated into the following research questions: How interdisciplinary is the field of the human dimension in fisheries modeling? Is there a gap between the HDAs that are modeled and those that could be modeled? Are HDAs modeled in an interdisciplinary manner? Is there a relation between the modeled HDAs and the modeling approaches? CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK Interdisciplinarity In this study we understand interdisciplinarity as an attempt at mutual interaction between disciplinary components that involves crossing the boundaries of several academic disciplines with contrasting research paradigms in order to create new theories and knowledge (Tress et al. 2005). Interdisciplinary activities and studies apply synthesize integrate or transcend parts of two or more disciplines with a common goal (Tress et al. 2005; Huutoniemi et al. 2010; Chiu et al. 2013). To make the distinction multidisciplinarity involves several academic disciplines that have multiple parallel goals often with the purpose of comparison but does not cross subject boundaries or aim for any form of integration. Transdisciplinarity combines interdisciplinarity with a participatory approach by involving non-academic participants and knowledge bodies to create new knowledge and theory (Tress et al. 2005). To assess interdisciplinarity within the field of the HD in fisheries models we used the typology and indicators for interdisciplinarity developed by Huutoniemi et al. (2010). This typology considers interdisciplinarity on three dimensions: (1) the scope of interdisciplinarity i.e. what is being integrated; (2) the type of interdisciplinary interaction i.e. how it is being done; Frontiers in Marine Science | www.frontiersin.org 2 July 2019 | Volume 6 | Article 369 Weber et al. Human Dimension in Fisheries Models and (3) the types of goals i.e. why an interdisciplinary approach is being used. The scope of interdisciplinarity refers to the conceptual and cultural distance between the participating disciplines or research fields. It is understood as narrow if the participating fields are conceptually close to each other (e.g. life sciences and biological sciences) whereas it is considered broad when the fields are conceptually diverse (e.g. law and engineering). The type of interdisciplinary interaction describes how interdisciplinarity is being carried out and three different approaches can be distinguished: empirical methodological and theoretical. Empirical interdisciplinarity integrates different types of empirical data (e.g. qualitative and quantitative data). Methodological interdisciplinarity implies the integration of different methodological approaches. As we chose to explore only models as a fisheries research methodology this dimension of interdisciplinarity has not been assessed in this study. Theoretical interdisciplinarity occurs when concepts models or theories from more than one field or discipline are synthesized in order to develop new theoretical tools (Huutoniemi et al. 2010). By considering only empirical and theoretical interdisciplinarity we assumed that the HD should be fit into fisheries models and did not consider potential other methodological approaches that could be suitable for studying fisheries as SES and providing science advice to management. The types of interdisciplinary goals can be epistemologically oriented to increase knowledge or instrumentally oriented to achieve an extra-academic goal or solve a societal problem. The types of interdisciplinary goals can also have a mixed orientation when they have both an epistemological and an instrumental orientation. METHODOLOGY In order to address our research questions we employed a systematic literature review (SLR) approach that consisted of three consecutive steps: (1) relevant literature was collected and selected in a systematic reproducible manner; (2) the selected literature was analyzed in a qualitative way through content analysis and hierarchical coding which was followed by (3) the design of data visualizations. Subsequently we applied a typology and indicators to assess interdisciplinarity within the data. In the SLR we classified models as any method that the authors of the publication referred to as a model which included qualitative and quantitative models process and conceptual models and frameworks. All the applied methods are explained in detail in the following sections followed by their limitations. Literature Collection and Selection In order to select a large enough sample of papers on fisheries models to study the practices being used to model the HD we decided to use a systematic approach. This provides transparency and replicability and makes the choice of the publications under review comprehensible by determining: 1. a set of keywords to be used as search terms in an unbiased academic search engine and 2. clear inclusion and exclusion criteria by which the resulting literature will be evaluated. These steps are described in sections Search Terms and Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria. This methodology is commonly referred to as a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) and is an effective approach for sampling the literature in a systematic and reproducible way. SLRs are commonly applied in fields such as medical science (e.g. Weitzen et al. 2004) and software engineering (e.g. Kitchenham et al. 2009) and they are an emerging method in fields such as organizational studies (Maier et al. 2016) education (e.g. Hainey et al. 2016) and marine and coastal studies (e.g. Liquete et al. 2013). Search Terms The literature search was conducted using the scientific search engine Scopus (www.scopus.com) where the search terms �fisheries� �model?� and �common fisheries policy� were employed to select for peer-reviewed publications on fisheries models. All subject areas as identified by Scopus (i.e. life sciences health sciences physical sciences social sciences and humanities) and all possible publication years were selected. The precise search string used in Scopus can be found in Appendix S1 (Supplementary Material). The search was conducted on 25/08/2015. We used the term �fisheries� in order to select for models with a system perspective rather than select for models only considering the environmental components (e.g. fish) and therefore we did not use the search term �fish?.� To achieve a general perspective on the field of fisheries modeling we chose not to limit this study to a particular modeling technique (e.g. Bayesian belief networks) or a particular model type (e.g. stock assessment). Thus we sampled models created for a large variety of fisheries that are performing under similar managerial assumptions. Among the multitude of possible managerial assumptions we chose the Common Fisheries Policy of the European Union (EU) a common set of rules that applies to all EU fishing fleets and EU fish stocks. This decision was driven mainly by the fact that the EU fisheries are among the most extensively studied in the world (Jaric? et al. 2012) therefore presumably offering a large but still manageable sample for qualitative analysis. It also allowed us to narrow down the number of publications to a number feasible for qualitative analysis. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria The full text of all publications was downloaded and the publication metadata was exported from Scopus including authors title year journal and journal subject areas. All articles were screened for relevance to the study objectives and included or excluded based on the criteria listed in Table 1. Throughout this process we followed the guidelines for systematic reviews in conservation and environmental management (Pullin and Stewart 2006) and the PRISMA reporting guidelines (Moher et al. 2009; see Appendix S2). These guidelines ensure a thorough execution of the sampling and analysis of the literature while carrying out the SLR.

Content Analysis The SLR process was followed by a qualitative analysis and synthesis through content analysis which is a research methodology for making valid inferences from texts in a replicable manner (Krippendorff 2013). This study followed a problem-driven approach to content analysis which means that it was motivated by epistemic questions about currently inaccessible information that the text is assumed to be able to answer (Krippendorff 2013). During our content analysis coding categories and recording instructions were developed and an analytical procedure was selected. These steps are explained in detail in sections Model Classification and Coding of the Human Dimension Aspects. Model Classification Information on the types of models e.g. Bayesian belief network bioeconomic model etc. were extracted from the publications and recorded in Microsoft Excel 2016. In order to classify the models we applied a general model typology based on Hanneman (1995) which differentiates between mathematical statistical and simulation models. In addition we added the model category �conceptual� based on Miles and Huberman (1994 p. 18). The applied typology distinguished betweenmodels as follows: Mathematical A mathematical model translates the relations among concepts in a theory into explicit dynamic formalism using mathematical concepts and formulas. Statistical A statistical model describes the probabilistic estimation of parameters from empirical data in such a way as to choose the values of parameters that are most likely to have produced the data. Simulation A simulation model consists of a number of states i.e. actors or variables or both and a set of explicit hypotheses about how change occurs in these states over time. In computer simulations these states are expressed as systems of equations using mathematical or logical operators. Conceptual A conceptual model or framework explains either graphically or in narrative form the main things to be studied�the key factors constructs or variables and the presumed relationships among them. The models and frameworks can be rudimentary or elaborate theory-driven or commonsensical descriptive or causal. Coding of the Human Dimension Aspects The content of the selected publications i.e. the information relevant to the research questions of this study was analyzed through coding and the development of a category system. Coding is the process of categorizing and organizing information into a meaningful framework (Johnson 2007) to empower and speed up systematic qualitative data analysis (Lofland et al. 2006). The term coding refers to the process of reading the data and dividing it into meaningful analytical units also known as segmenting the data. Once a meaningful unit has been identified it is coded whichmeans that the unit is marked with a descriptive word or a category name. During coding a master list is maintained in order to keep track of all previously coded units so that codes can be reapplied to new data segments each time an appropriate unit or segment is discovered within the text (Johnson 2007). We developed an indicative code which means that it was created by the researcher whilst directly inspecting the data in contrast to for example using a pre-existing set of codes that had been developed a priori to the analysis. We coded the data according to a hierarchical category system. This enables organization of the data into different levels or categories based on the idea that some themes are more general than others and that codes are therefore related vertically (Johnson 2007). We used the term �function� to describe the categorical relationship between the codes. A functional relationship between two variables essentially means: X is used for Y (Johnson 2007). In the code developed for this study the main aspect modeled by a publication or the main subject of the model was coded as the first hierarchical unit representing the general theme and overall goal. The main aspect modeled was identified based on what the authors themselves stated in the title the abstract or the introduction to the article (e.g. �. . .we modeled the exploitation of a fishery. . . �). The theme identified as the overall goal or main aspect of the model was categorized into one of three dimensions: human/social economic or environmental or a combination of Frontiers in Marine Science | www.frontiersin.org 4 July 2019 | Volume 6 | Article 369 Weber et al. Human Dimension in Fisheries Models these (see section Assigning the Dimensions Identified in the Fisheries Models to the Human Dimension Aspects). Only studies whose main aspect was identified as the HDwere analyzed in depth via further hierarchical coding to determine through which variables they had been modeled. Two more descending hierarchies were introduced into the coding which resulted in a three-level code hierarchy: Level 1�the main HDA; Level 2�variables that were used to model Level 1 and the functional relationship between them; Level 3�variables that were employed to model Level 2 and the functional relationship between them. Inmoremathematical terms this can be described as follows: HDA = F(b c) with b = G(d e) where HDA is the main HDA (Level 1) which is modeled as a function F of the variables b and c and where b is modeled as a function G of the variables d and e. All these variables were coded in NVivo 11 (QSR International Pty Ltd 2015). The codes which are represented as nodes in NVivo were assigned to hierarchical categories in order to distinguish between Level 1 Level 2 and Level 3 variables (Figure 1). Assigning the Dimensions Identified in the Fisheries Models to the Human Dimension Aspects The identified HDAs and other variables were assigned to the dimensions described previously (human/social economic and environmental) based on the indicators for sustainable development of marine capture fisheries developed by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations (FAO Fishery Resources Division 1999). We included the FAO�s governance dimension in the social one and renamed the latter as the human dimension. The economic dimension was treated as a dimension in its own as the tradition of treating it separately in fisheries science seems to be very strong (Haapasaari et al. FIGURE 1 | A conceptual display of the hierarchy of variables used to model the main Human Dimension Aspects (HDA) of the human dimension fisheries models. Level 1 represents the main HDA and Levels 2 and 3 represent the variables (bc and de) that were used in a functional relationship to model the HDA. 2012). We found the FAO framework appropriate given its global penetration level and authority in fisheries science but we are aware that other categorizations and divisions of fisheries systems exist (e.g. Charles 2000). The HDAs were categorized into three topics as described by Bennett et al. (2017): social phenomena social processes and individual attributes. Enumeration and Visualization of the Qualitative Data The qualitative coding analysis of the publications was followed by enumeration which refers to the quantification of the qualitative data and coding results for example the number of HDAs and the human/social economic and environmental variables for each HDA were counted. The enumeration of the qualitative data was conducted using the software NVivo 11 (QSR International Pty Ltd 2015) because computer-aided qualitative data analysis allows for the automated enumeration while enabling all data to be exported into other formats (e.g. csv excel etc.). Visualizations were created using Gephi (Version 0.9.1) which is an open source visualization tool for graph and network analysis (Bastian et al. 2009). A detailed description of this approach is provided in Appendix S3 (Supplementary Material). Assessment of Interdisciplinarity Interdisciplinarity was assessed based on the typology and indicators described by Huutoniemi et al. (2010) as explained in section Conceptual Framework. We assessed interdisciplinarity in the modeling of the HD in fisheries through: (1) indicators of the scope of interdisciplinarity (narrow or broad i.e. what is being integrated) and we assessed interdisciplinarity within the modeled HDAs through (2) the types of interdisciplinary interaction (empirical or theoretical i.e. how the integration is done). The former was determined by an inspection of the diversity of the journals in which the papers were published and their subject areas and as well as the diversity of the types of models. The latter was determined by inspecting the diversity of the HDAs found within the models (theoretical interdisciplinarity) and examining the diversity of the fisheries dimensions (human economic environmental) within the variables used to model the HDAs (empirical interdisciplinarity). It is important to emphasize that we assessed the interdisciplinarity of the sample as a whole (based on the aggregated empirical data we had collected) rather than looking at each individual model separately. We did not asses the types of goals because this was not the primary purpose of our study. Limitations of the Applied Methodology One limitation of the SLR approach as with any keywordbased study is that the choice of keywords is prone to human subjectivity and that relevant literature can be potentially excluded if the keywords are not present in the searchable fields e.g. abstract title or keywords of the item. Also the similar managerial assumptions introduced through the keyword search term �common fisheries policy� potentially limit the scope of the search for the incorporation of the HD into fisheries models in the European Union. Additionally the number of publications reviewed is often much smaller than in for example Frontiers in Marine Science | www.frontiersin.org 5 July 2019 | Volume 6 | Article 369 Weber et al. Human Dimension in Fisheries Models computational approaches such as topic modeling (Syed and Weber 2018). Another limitation of the SLR approach is the exclusion of gray literature. Gray literature is not indexed in the same manner as scientific publications and therefore cannot be sampled in the same way. On the other hand gray literature does not undergo the same rigorous peer-review process as scientific journal publications which gave us a good enough reason to exclude it and focus our interest on peer-reviewed scientific publications. We are aware that due to the limitations of this approach relevant documents might have been excluded and are therefore absent from our sample. Our work reflects the academic contributions to the incorporation of HD into fisheries models but not the fisheries science contributions as a whole (including modeling of stock assessments and advice) to this domain. However since the aim of this study was to select a large sample of the literature in a transparent manner rather than to identify all of the literature in the field the methodological approach described above was considered sufficient. Another limitation of the SLR approach is inherent to qualitative analysis and synthesis: it is an interpretative process and the results can vary between human coders. Therefore to ensure coding consistency the coding was conducted by only one of the authors. Interdisciplinarity is difficult to assess (Huutoniemi et al. 2010) and the approach applied here is therefore another limitation of this study. The measures used to assess interdisciplinarity (journal subject areas model diversity HD categories and diversity of variables used to model HD) are indicators and thus not direct measures of interdisciplinarity because they do not measure actual integration. This is due to the fact that the exact form and degree of integration in interdisciplinary research are often difficult to identify within a publication if it is not made explicit (e.g. whether the theories underlying the model were integrated and which theories they were). However we assume interdisciplinarity (and not multidisciplinarity) since various variables and data from HD and natural sciences were integrated into the models. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION How Interdisciplinary Is the Field of Modeling the Human Dimension? The Scopus search generated a total of 211 publications out of which 131 were excluded based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria in Table 1. This left 80 publications that were eligible for further qualitative analysis. Within these 80 publications we identified 31 papers as modeling an HDA based on our coding criteria of the content analysis (see Appendix S4 in the Supplementary Material for a full list of these papers). These 31 articles had been published in 20 different journals which were listed in eight different subject areas in Scopus (Table 2). While some of the subject areas can be considered relatively similar from a conceptual point of view (e.g. environmental sciences and agricultural and biological sciences) other subject areas were conceptually diverse and crossed the boundaries of TABLE 2 | The subject areas and corresponding journals identified in this study.

Numbers are only indicated if there was more than one article per journal. Note that several journals are included in more than one subject area. broad intellectual areas (e.g. social science and computer science). At the same time many of these journals were registered in more than one field (e.g. Marine Policy is listed in three fields Land Economics is listed in two fields). This spread of journals and Frontiers in Marine Science | www.frontiersin.org 6 July 2019 | Volume 6 | Article 369 Weber et al. Human Dimension in Fisheries Models subject areas together with the presence of the same journals in multiple fields could indicate the potential for both narrow and broad interdisciplinarity in the modeling of the HD in fisheries. At the same time it is interesting to note that even though the models we analyzed were about HD and one would expect these to be published mainly in journals in the field of social sciences the most highly-represented subject field was environmental science with social sciences being only half the size. This result is in line with the fact that fisheries science has been traditionally dominated by natural scientists (Link 2010). The journal with the highest frequency of appearance in the dataset wasMarine Policy accounting for almost one-third of the articles on modeling an HDA in fisheries. This is not surprising considering that the journal describes its contributions as a �unique combination of analyses in the principal social science disciplines relevant to the formulation of marine policy� (Elsevier 2018) while the main topics published by this journal are fisheries management conservation fishing gear and models (Syed et al. 2018). A total of 27 different model types were identified within the publications where the model categorization showed that statistical models were the most common models (n = 14) followed by conceptual models (n = 8) simulation models (n = 7) and mathematical models (n = 5) (Table 3). The 27 different model types range from classic economics models (e.g. econometrics models) to conceptual frameworks (Table 3). As is the case for publication outlets and subject areas this spread of model types could indicate the potential for both narrow and broad interdisciplinarity in the field being analyzed. The application of various modeling approaches could be a potential first step toward an integration of the HD into fisheries assessments (Schl�ter et al. 2012). Almost one-fifth of the publications included in this analysis used a bioeconomic model. The greater use of these models is likely related to their longterm use in fisheries dating back to Gordon (1954) and Clark (1973). It might also indicate the interdisciplinary practice of borrowing methods and tools from across the disciplines in an effort to address the needs dictated by the specific problem at hand (Huutoniemi et al. 2010). It is also possible that the uptake of models more suitable for modeling the HD e.g. agent-based models (Schl�ter et al. 2012) and social network analysis (Scott 2017) is rather slow. Is There a Gap Between the Human Dimension Aspects That Are Modeled and Those That Could Be Modeled? A total of 20 different main HDAs (Table 4) were identified within the 31 publications. These aspects cover all three of the categories of topics relating to the HD described by Bennett et al. (2017) which could be taken as a sign of theoretical interdisciplinarity at the field level. However the number of specific aspects that have been modeled is rather small compared with the wealth of HDAs that could be modeled. As stated in Syed et al. (2018) the HD in fisheries in particular or in any similar social-ecological system in general could be explored by addressing topics TABLE 3 | Model categories and model types extracted from the publications in this study.

Compared to this list the results for the 31 papers reviewed in this study reveal a significant gap between the HDAs that were modeled and the ones that could be modeled. However considering the small sample size this gap does not necessarily reflect the situation in the Common Fisheries Policy area. A theory describes our understanding of the components and aspects of reality and their interactions. Once developed a theory guides modelers in their decisions regarding what elements relationships and processes to include into their models. It is therefore the case that a model itself and the generalizability of its results can be judged by the validity and quality of the theories incorporated (Raser 1972).

Count for HDA is the number of publications that model the respective HDA. Model categories include mathematical (M) statistical (S) simulation (Sim) and conceptual (C). complex systems a single theory taken in isolation is rarely sufficient (Orcutt et al. 1961). From this perspective achieving theoretical interdisciplinarity is a pre-requisite for integrative theories and/or theories from more than one field assuming that these theories are suitable for integration. The low number of HDAs that result from our systematic literature review may be due to a shortage of adequate theories to a lack of appropriate HDA data or to both. Are Human Dimension Aspects Modeled in an Interdisciplinary Manner? The 20 Level 1 HDAs were modeled using a total of 43 different Level 2 variables and 137 different Level 3 variables (see Appendices S5 S6 in the Supplementary Material). All visual representations of the HDAs are presented in Figure 3 and Appendix S7 (Supplementary Material). Perception and views has the most Level 2 variables. Fish auctions has the smallest number of Level 3 variables with only three (Figure 3) whereas socio-bio-economic consequences has the largest number of Level 3 variables with 37. Fish auctions also has the smallest number of variables overall with a total of five across Level 2 and Level 3. Other HDAs with generally low numbers of Level 2 and Level 3 variables are fisheries dependency (n = 6) and decision making (n = 6). The majority of the HDAs have a total number of variables between 10 and 20. The HDA socio-bio-economic consequences has the largest number of variables overall with a total of 41. This variety of Level 2 and Level 3 variables might indicate the existence of several theories around the same aspect of Level 1 something which contributes to theoretical interdisciplinarity of the field. The number of aspects modeled and the variables assigned to each dimension are shown in Figure 2. A close inspection of this figure reveals that the proportion of each of the three fisheries dimensions changes with an increase in the depth of analysis. Thus at Level 2 the count and usage of human dimension variables are higher compared to the economic variables. Whereas at Level 3 human dimension variables� usage is much lower compared to economic variables� usage. This diversification might indicate an empirical interdisciplinary nature to the modeling of the HD. However it might also indicate a lack of suitable operationalisation of human dimension variables and consequently a lack of suitable data to use in modeling. At the same time this highlights how the HD can be modeled using economic and environmental variables and the entanglement of the dimensions. Only one HDA governance was modeled entirely through human dimension variables on all levels. Fish auctions was the only HDA where all Level 2 and Level 3 factors were economic (Figure 3). The two HDAs fishing strategy and institutional inertia were modeled using Level 2 and Level 3 variables from only two different dimensions whereas fishing strategy was modeled using factors from the economic and environmental dimensions and institutional inertia was modeled using factors from the economic and human dimensions (see Appendix S7 in the Supplementary Material). Thirteen HDAs were modeled using Level 2 and Level 3 variables Frontiers in Marine Science | www.frontiersin.org 8 July 2019 | Volume 6 | Article 369 Weber et al. Human Dimension in Fisheries Models FIGURE 2 | Occurrence and usage of variables for all three levels from the four different dimensions human economic environmental and other.

FIGURE 3 | A visual representation of the Human Dimension Aspects (HDAs) governance (left) and fish auctions (right) and the Level 2 and Level 3 variables that were used to model these HDAs. The size of each node represents the relative importance of the variable (i.e. the number of publications using it) and the color indicates its dimension (pink: human; blue: economic; green: environmental; white: other/more than one dimension). The position of each node (left�middle�right) indicates its level (Level 1�Level 2�Level 3). from three different dimensions (n = 12) and five HDAs were modeled using Level 2 and Level 3 variables from all dimensions. These were: socio-bio-economic consequences compliance evaluation of management plans perception and views and TAC setting process. Overall variables from the economic dimension were used the most often (Figure 2); in particular cost (n = 13) effort (n = 13) and price (n = 12) were the most used economic variables in Level 3. The variables from the human dimension that were used most often in Level 3 were demography (n = 4) Frontiers in Marine Science | www.frontiersin.org 9 July 2019 | Volume 6 | Article 369 Weber et al. Human Dimension in Fisheries Models regulation (n = 4) and employment (n = 3) whereas the most frequently used variables from the environmental dimension in Level 3 were stock (n = 13) area (n = 6) and fishing mortality (n = 4). This study suggests that HDAs are modeled using mainly economic and partly environmental variables which represents the data typically available for fisheries assessments. Some of the HDAs such as governance might be very difficult (if not maybe impossible) to be expressed in numerical terms. Is There a Relation Between the Modeled HDAs and the Modeling Approaches? The HD categories �social phenomena� and �social processes� contain modeling approaches from all four model categories (mathematical statistical simulation and conceptual) while the HD category �individual attribute� contains only statistical simulation and conceptual models (Table 4). This indicates that the modeling of HD categories is independent from the modeling approach and that each HD category can be captured through a range of mathematical statistical simulation and conceptual models. The lack of mathematical models in the individual attributes HD category is likely due to our small sample size. Most of the HDAs were modeled using only one of the model categories such as the HDAs regulation (only mathematical) effort allocation (only simulation) evaluation of management plans (only conceptual) and enter and exit the fishery (only statistical). In some cases an HDA was modeled using two different modeling categories e.g. fisheries dependency has been modeled in both a mathematical and a statistical way. The same can be found for compliance. Commitment was modeled using statistical models and a simulation model. Perception and views was modeled using statistical models and a conceptual model (Table 4). In the modeling categories some differences in the interdisciplinarity of howHDAs were modeled can be oberserved by inspecting the diversity of the variables used (see Table 4 and Figures in Appendix S7 in the Supplementary Material). Mathematical models commonly included more economic variables as apparent in enforcement and regulation. Whereas most of the statistical models included variables from all three dimension (human economic environmental) and appeared to allow for a more interdisciplinary modeling approach. Some of the statistical models used more human dimension variables than others such as commitment while other statistical models included more economic variables such as fishing strategy and enter and exit the fishery. Simulation models included mostly economic variables but were still interdisciplinary as they included variables from all dimension even if only few variables from the human dimension were present. Conceptual models allowed for the inclusion of most social variables but were the least interdisciplinary model category as they often included variables from only one dimension. For example governance contained only human dimension variables and fish auctions contained only economic variables while institutional inertia contained only two dimensions which made these conceptual HDA models the least interdisciplinary Regarding the different model types used to model the HDAs only few model types were used for more than one HDA. For example bioeconomic models were used to model three different HDAs i.e. regulation commitment and effort allocation; while random utility models were used to model the HDAs enter and exit of the fishery andm�tier selection. Overall our study shows how HDAs can be explored through all four modeling approaches from mathematical statistical simulation to conceptual independent from what HDA category the HDA is. It also highlights how the same model type (e.g. bioeconomic model) can be used to model different HDAs from different HD categories. In addition whether a model is interdisciplinary or not appears to be independent of the HD category and modeling approach as interdisciplinarity (based on the diversity of variables used from the different dimensions see Figures in Appendix S7 in the Supplementary Material) can be found to different degrees within each of the mathematical statistical simulation and conceptual model categories as well as the different model types. How to Advance the Interdisciplinarity of the Field As a first step to advance the interdisciplinarity of the field we suggest a protocol based on Huutoniemi et al. (2010) that succinctly describes the elements necessary for assessing various interdisciplinary typologies shown in Table 5. Such a protocol could guide scientists on how to take an interdisciplinary approach during model development and implementation. It is also paramount for the advancement of the field that HD models are reproducible. Many of the descriptions of models in published articles are incomplete which makes it impossible to re-implement them or replicate their results (Railsback and Grimm 2012). As we have ourselves encountered when carrying out this study model descriptions are often �a wordy mixture of factual descriptions and lengthy justifications explanations and discussions of all kinds� (Railsback and Grimm 2012 p. 36). Therefore we also suggest that this protocol is used as a documentation tool in order to help modelers to express the interdisciplinary characteristics of their models clearly. This would also aid model communication in-depth model comprehension model assessment model replication model comparison theory building and code generation (M�ller et al. 2014). Social issues are often complex and understanding these issues from SES perspective will require interdisciplinary efforts from the natural and social sciences as well as the humanities (Urquhart et al. 2014). This assertion is backed by this empirical study which brings evidence on how entangled the HD is when viewing fisheries as SES. Multi- and interdisciplinarity would entail the transfer of knowledge tools and methods from a multitude of disciplines into the field of fisheries science making it possible to integrate various data inputs (e.g. quantitative and qualitative data). The outlined empirical results in our study demonstrate through which model categories and model types the HD was addressed. These approaches could be expanded through other existing methods such as agent-based models Frontiers in Marine Science | www.frontiersin.org 10 July 2019 | Volume 6 | Article 369 Weber et al. Human Dimension in Fisheries Models TABLE 5 | An overview of the protocol for assessing the interdisciplinarity of models based on Huutoniemi et al. (2010). Narrow Broad What Scope of interdisciplinarity What disciplines and knowledge bodies were involved and integrated e.g. what disciplines contributed to this model what stakeholders added knowledge to the concept of the model etc. Empirical Methodological Theoretical How Type of interdisciplinarity Which types of data and data sources (knowledge bodies) were included (e.g. social economic environmental; qualitative data quantitative data academic data non-academic data from stakeholders/local ecological knowledge etc.)? Which different modeling tools/methods were integrated? Is this a new integrative modeling method involving different stakeholders (e.g. participatory modeling)? How was integration achieved? Which theories were used and integrated (e.g. which social theories were used?)? Epistemological Instrumental Why Goal of interdisciplinarity The production of new understanding and knowledge. (Why do we need this understanding? What is the new knowledge for?). To solve a problem or a societal challenge (What is the problem the model is trying to solve?) systems analysis and social network analysis from domains ranging from political science to business organization. Such methods could be integrated into fisheries science and used to study societies social interactions and people�s behavior in fisheries (Libre et al. 2015; Scott 2017). Through an expansion of current practices a wider range of the HDAs could be considered in fisheries models to better reflect the diversity of the HD. This endeavor could be fostered further through the inclusion of scientists from the social sciences and the humanities right from the start of a project (Criddle 2016). In this way they can contribute to the formulation of the research questions that ought to be answered by a model which could lead to a more diversified investigation of the HD. The challenges of performing interdisciplinary research are not new as they have been already identified 20 years ago (see for example Volume 2 Issue 4 1999 of the journal Ecosystems). Thus in order to address the issues identified by the above analysis it might be that fisheries science will require new types of experts besides biologists mathematicians and statisticians: (1) scientists from the social sciences and the humanities; (2) scientists with interdisciplinary backgrounds who can address fisheries from a more holistic perspective and apply the concept of SES to multi- and interdisciplinary fisheries workgroups and research; and (3) modelers with the latest skillset who are trained to use tools that can reflect fisheries as SES and include the HD in an interdisciplinary way. This would potentially lead to the rise and also the recognition of a new kind of natural resources expert: interdisciplinary individuals with the flexibility required to move between fields and explore various SES e.g. sustainability science (Haider et al. 2018) conservation science and complexity science. Researchers putting aside their differences and finding better ways to communicate could support the practice of interdisciplinary science and disciplinary cross-fertilization (Arlinghaus et al. 2014) whilst the interdisciplinary development of conceptual models could support communication between social and natural scientists (HallArber et al. 2009). Some things in the culture of science might have to change e.g. arrogances and the way we speak to each other but we also need to rethink our assumptions values and institutional structures (Degnbol et al. 2006). Researchers from cross-disciplinary research programs as well as innovative graduate training programs would have to become more involved. In addition interdisciplinary career choices would have to be rewarded instead of generating a fear of risking one�s career (Rhoten and Parker 2004; Fischer et al. 2012). Besides experts and scientists from different disciplines the insight of stakeholders should also be taken into account. Stakeholders and practitioners such as management authorities and non-governmental organizations can contribute to the modeling process through co-creation (Santiago et al. 2015; Wood et al. 2015). Co-creation could highlight the importance of HD components and lead to assurances that managers and policy makers will take the behavior of individuals and organizations into consideration within their fishing communities. This would make models of the HD more relevant for societal challenges management and decision making while contributing to the scientific knowledge production and supporting local and global policies and sustainability goals such as the EU�s Common Fisheries Policy and the United Nations� Sustainable Development Goals (United Nations 2015). Furthermore with this study we wish to stimulate the discussion on how best to model the HD of SES. Based on our empirical results the HD is largely modeled using statistical models while all model types are using mostly economic and environmental variables. One could argue that the field of HD modeling needs to diversify modeling approaches and requires more operationalisable social theories and more data relevant to these theories. At the same time using more easily available economic and environmental data is a more practical short-term Frontiers in Marine Science | www.frontiersin.org 11 July 2019 | Volume 6 | Article 369 Weber et al. Human Dimension in Fisheries Models approach. In contrast some argue for extreme caution in modeling the HD and social phenomena in general (n� Aodha and Edmonds 2017). These decisions will likely be made on an individual level but we hope that researchers from all fields can engage in these discussions and share their experiences as well as the reasons for the approaches they have taken and their lessons learned. CONCLUSIONS This study identifies a variety of HDAs that have been investigated in the context of fisheries models. HDAs can be modeled in an interdisciplinary manner through a wide diversity of modeling types and this study can potentially provide some useful guidance for those seeking to include HDA into fisheries models. However there is broad potential for the expansion of the HD in fisheries models as there is potential for diversification of the types of models. This expansion is important in order to increase our understanding of fisheries systems in general and to better reflect the interdisciplinarity of the HD field in order to understand and support sustainable fisheries. In the support of modeling the HD in a SES context interdisciplinary approaches are required. Such efforts need to focus on several aspects including: acknowledging that exploring the HD requires interdisciplinarity; early involvement of all relevant disciplines and stakeholders in model development through co-creation; expansion and improved development and integration of tools for the modeling of HDAs; the formulation of operationalisable theories and the collection and inclusion of more data from the HD. To further improve and advance the interdisciplinarity of HD modeling in the long term model transparency documentation and communication will be key. A model publication should be easy for the reader to understand and follow and it should make the HDAs and levels of interdisciplinarity explicit. Clear model descriptions will enable interested readers and modelers to understand how interdisciplinarity and HD modeling was achieved thus facilitating model uptake and re-use by scientists managers and policy makers.

2021 SIEBERS ET AL first steps toward RAT (SSC2019).pdf,Chapter 24 First Steps Towards RAT: A Protocol for Documenting Data Use in the Agent-Based Modeling Process Peer-Olaf Siebers  Sebastian Achter Cristiane Palaretti Bernardo Melania Borit  and Edmund Chattoe-Brown Abstract While there is a number of frameworks and protocols in Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) that support the documentation of different aspects of a simulation study it is surprising to find only a small number dealing with the handling of data. Here we present the results of discussions we had on the topic at the Lorentz Center workshop on Integrating Qualitative and Quantitative Evidence using Social Simulation (8-12 April 2019 Leiden the Netherlands). We believe that important distinctions to be considered in the context of data use documentation are the differences of data use in relation to modeling approaches (theory driven etc.) and data documentation needs at the different stages in the modeling process (conceptualization specification calibration and validation). What we hope to achieve by presenting this paper at this conference with the help of the community is to move forward the development of a generally acceptable protocol for documenting data use in the ABM process.

Introduction A big problem in Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) is rigorous and transparent use of data [1]. Often a model is broadly explained but justification in terms of decisions aboutwhat data has been used how it has been used andwhy themodeler has decided to use it in this way is most often missing. This can be very frustrating making it difficult to understand and perhaps replicate the model. Looking at practices within the simulation domain there are some rigorous procedures in place [2 3] however mostly referring to specific fields stages of the modeling process or simulation paradigms. There is a number of frameworks and protocols in ABM that support the documentation of different aspects of a simulation study e.g. ODD (Overview Design concepts and Details) DOE (Design of Experiments) EABSS (Engineering AgentBased Social Simulations). The ODD protocol aims to provide a standard format for describing individual-based and agent-based models [4]. Several additions to the original protocol have been proposed in order to increase its functionality i.e. ODD + D (ODD + Decision) [5] ODD + 2D (ODD + Decision + Data) [1] ODD + P (ODD + Provenance) [6]. The DOE framework focuses on increased transparency and effective communication through the systematic design of experiments [7]. The EABSS framework focuses on driving and documenting the model development process of mixed approach models [8]. However it is relevant to consider that some frameworks emphasize certain steps of a simulation studymore strongly while others have a more holistic approach. Given the emphasis on promoting such standards in order to increase scientific rigor and transparency in ABM it is surprising to find only a small number dealing with the handling of data whether quantitative or qualitative in ABMs. Themost notable effort is made by Laatabi et al. [1] by proposing an extension of theODDprotocol to improve the description of data-model connections. However our goal is to move forward with this discussion posing further questions: � What can we learn from achievements regarding data documentation in other disciplines? That includes existing standards with the field of simulation research outside ABM but also from fields with similar challenges (e.g. the interdisciplinarity or diverse data types). � Is there a need to distinguish a reporting protocol for different model approaches (data-driven vs. theory-driven vs. participatory)? � What specific reporting requirements come with different stages in the modeling process (e.g. conceptualization specification calibration or validation)? The initiative presented here arose from a Lorentz Center workshop on Integrating Qualitative and Quantitative Evidence using Social Simulation (8-12 April 2019 Leiden the Netherlands). At this workshop we came together as a multidisciplinary group of junior and senior modelers. Our aim was to create a framework for augmenting rigor and transparency (RAT) of data use in ABM when it comes to publication of these models. The RAT framework is still work in progress. What we 24 First Steps Towards RAT: A Protocol � 259 present here is our strategy for developing this framework and some possible questions that we considered to include with corresponding fictive responses for demonstration purposes. What we hope to gain from presenting this extended abstract at the Social Simulation Conference 2019 is feedback on our initial work. We are aware that the creation process of an ABM is shaped by researchers� individual nuances. Hence feedback from looking back at one�s own research projects is of high value for us. Besides the presentation based on the extended abstract we are also participating in the poster session and organize a round table. Thus we are looking forward to meeting those of you who would like to contribute to developing the protocol with their feedback. Methodology In order to develop the framework we used the following strategy. We looked at typical stages in the modeling process within which we identified issues regarding data requirements. We summarized those requirements in form of questions in a protocol format. We recognized that there can be fundamental differences in the model approach that lead to different reporting issues for data used also within the different stages of the modeling process. Thus we distinguished two generic modeling approaches: (1) theory-driven; (2) data-driven. For evaluation purposes and to uncover gaps in our protocol during the development process we used the working example of a theory-driven model. The same procedure is pending for an example of a data-driven model. Lastly we also recognized modeling approaches such as mixed approaches (i.e. partly theory-driven partly data-driven) and participatory modeling not neatly fitting into one of the approaches hence probably representing a separate category we need to consider. Our goal was to develop a framework that is easy to use and to only include the information required for rigorous and transparent documentation i.e. to keep it as concise as possible in order tomotivate people to use it.Whenworking on it we asked ourselves two questions: �What should be in such a protocol when it comes to the use of data?� and �What is the data-related thing that is most frustrating when it is left out of an existing model documentation making it difficult to replicate/understand the model?�. What we were aiming to avoid was creating a protocol that due to its complexity would be counterproductive. 260 P.-O. Siebers et al. RAT Framework RAT Roadmap The RAT roadmap consist of several distinct steps to guide the modeling process. Currently they are labelled as START SPECIFICATION �DATARING� (i.e. the comprehensive consideration of the use of qualitative and quantitative data in an agent-based model) BUILDING MODEL PHYSICALLY and OUTPUT. In the START step we clarify the research question and make a decision regarding model type (theory driven data driven etc.). The decision about the latter will influence the specifics of the following steps. Assuming that we have a theory driven model in the SPECIFICATION stepwewill focus onmapping theory elements tomodel elements. The �DATARING� step provides a systematic account of relationship betweenmodel elements and data (which is why we have created a new term subsuming calibration validation and specification). In the BUILDING MODEL PHYSICALLY step we will use a subset of the ODD protocol (possibly with its extensions) to formally describe the model. Finally in the OUTPUT step we define the data that can be captured as output and which of these are used. RAT Protocol With the RAT protocol we aim to document data use throughout the modeling process. We used the RAT roadmap to organize the protocol and followed a WHATWHY strategy to combine the process of reporting and justification. We distinguish between the use of qualitative and quantitative data and we encourage the modeler to say why things that would be available have not been used. Furthermore we encourage the modeler to unveil hidden aspects of the model (e.g. we ask for all potential outputs of the model including unused ones) to support a �model reuse� culture. Conclusions In this study we have presented a prototype of the RAT framework. This captures the considerations that should go into the decision making during the modeling process. This framework intends to integrate available practices (e.g. ODD + 2D ODD + P DOE) and fill in the gaps. As such the framework can help with conceptual model validation as one has to be explicit about aspects of modeling and could spot errors or lacunae when one finds oneself stuck in completing later steps. Moreover it could be used for communicating simulation models to those who are not experts in ABM. 24 First Steps Towards RAT: A Protocol � 261 Wewould appreciate suggestions for items that should be included in the literature reviews �beta testers� and critical readers for the roadmap and protocol (from as many disciplines and modeling approaches as possible) reactions (whether positive or negative) to the initiative itself (including joining it!) and participation in the various activities we organize at the conference.

Teaching the principles and requirements of ethical AI to students is considered an essential part of this domain with an increasing number of technical AI courses taught at several higher-education institutions around the globe including content related to ethics. By using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) a generative probabilistic topic model this study uncovers topics in teaching ethics in AI courses and their trends related to where the courses are taught by whom and at what level of cognitive complexity and specificity according to Bloom�s taxonomy. In this exploratory study based on �2022 AI Access Foundation. All rights reserved. Javed Nasir Borit Vanh�e Zea Gupta Vinuesa & Qadir unsupervised machine learning we analyzed a total of 166 courses: 116 from North American universities 11 from Asia 36 from Europe and 10 from other regions. Based on this analysis we were able to synthesize a model of teaching approaches which we call BAG (Build Assess and Govern) that combines specific cognitive levels course content topics and disciplines affiliated with the department(s) in charge of the course. We critically assess the implications of this teaching paradigm and provide suggestions about how to move away from these practices. We challenge teaching practitioners and program coordinators to reflect on their usual procedures so that they may expand their methodology beyond the confines of stereotypical thought and traditional biases regarding what disciplines should teach and how. 1. Introduction Artificial Intelligence (AI) is advancing at an explosive rate playing a significant role in how we communicate learn and interact in society. AI professionals are creating intelligent solutions for almost every domain ranging from healthcare and food processing to entertainment and even warfare. More voices than ever recognize the opportunities offered by AI while also insisting on facilitating a responsible ethics-driven inclusive and context-aware implementation (Floridi et al. 2018)1. The AI community as a whole seems to be more aware than ever of the ethical crisis unleashed by AI (Tzachor et al. 2020). An essential solution stressed for decades by educational governmental and industrial organizations alike for addressing problematic issues that are raised or might be raised by technological development has been to incorporate ethics into teaching AI to tech professionals and to include in the curricula of future AI practitioners specific training that ranges from raising ethical awareness to developing concrete skills for the implementation of ethical guidelines (Nielsen 1972; Goldsmith & Burton 2017; Dignum 2021). This approach has been also acknowledged by for example the Special Interest Group in Computer Science Education (SIGCSE)2 constituted under the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) which has been organising a technical symposium annually since 1970 during which participants address problems common among educators and work to develop implement and/or evaluate computing programs curricula and syllabi.3 1. Some academics have also started the debate about how ethics-driven AI can also contribute to sustainable development (Vinuesa et al. 2020; Henriksson & Grunewald 2020; Gupta et al. 2020). Some of the areas where ethics-driven AI can have a positive impact on sustainability are related with interpretable and transparent deep-learning models. As discussed in the literature (Vinuesa & Sirmacek 2021) certain applications aimed at tackling the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDGs) related to eradication of poverty (Jean et al. 2016) may significantly benefit from interpretable models due to the fact that more profound actions can be taken to reduce poverty when the predictive model is transparent. Other important areas are related to equality and diversity of the AI working force which will have positive effects on the UNSDGs related to gender equality and reduced inequalities. 2. https://sigcse.org/events/symposia/index.html 3. The domain of teaching AI ethics is rapidly advancing with more than 180 academic articles published on this topic since 2020 (according to a search in Scopus December 2021). Many of these studies discuss more general aspects of AI ethics education (e.g. Hwang et al. 2020; Lin et al. 2021; Yang et al. 2021) while many others explore effective ways to teach the desired topics and skills (e.g. the use of science fiction Burton Goldsmith & Mattei 2018 or design fiction / speculative design Soden et al. 2019 to help anticipate and reflect on the potential downsides of technology design and to help recognizing potentially harmful scenarios). Practitioners have also built dedicated arenas for teaching tech ethics for example Embedded EthiCS at Harvard (Grosz et al. 2019); the Mozilla Foundation (https://foundation. 934 Get out of the BAG! Silos in AI Ethics Education Higher-education institutions have been trying to find the best ways in which to effectively teach the necessary knowledge skills and competences that can effectively and holistically train students (i.e. future technical AI developers) to blend an ability for AI development and use with an ethical mindset. The groundswell of interest around the theme of teaching AI ethics can be seen in the long list of recent tech ethics courses collected in a crowd-sourced list available at http://tinyurl.com/ethics-classes. The purpose of the present study is to analyze patterns of teaching AI ethics and to critically assess their implications. While academics have been studying the topics of teaching AI and AI ethics for more than half a century (e.g. Chand 1974; Gehman 1984; Martin et al. 1996; Applin 2006; Ahmad 2014) the systematic assessment of the topics developments and trends in teaching AI ethics is a relatively recent endeavor. However most of the previous research that focused on a systematic analysis of teaching AI ethics suffered from one or more of the following limitations: 1) having a limited disciplinary scope (e.g. integration of ethics only in courses in machine-learning Saltz et al. 2019; engineering Bielefeldt et al. 2019; Nasir et al. 2021; human-computer interaction Khademi & Hui 2020; software engineering Towell 2003; or distributed systems Abad Ortiz-Holguin & Boza 2021); 2) having a limited geographical coverage and as explained in Hughes et al. (2020) Mohamed et al. (2020) being biased towards Western cultures (e.g. Moller & Crick 2018; Fiesler et al. 2020; Garrett et al. 2020; Raji et al. 2021; Homkes & Strikwerda 2009); or 3) including courses taught at only one single level (e.g. introductory level Becker & Fitzpatrick 2019). Most importantly all these previous attempts to map the teaching AI ethics field are human-driven approaches with topics of interest manually identified based on grouping the instructor-described topics into higher-level categories (e.g. Fiesler et al. 2020) or on open coding (e.g. Garrett et al. 2020; Raji et al. 2021). However such approaches are sensitive to the subjectivity and noise inherent in human decisions and the limited ability of human analysts to work effectively at very large scales. To complement the previous approaches and expand the understanding of the situation this study pursues a novel strategy for the field of AI ethics education and leverages an automated data-driven approach based on topic modelling (Debortoli et al. 2016) to uncover hidden topics within AI ethics courses. More specifically we uncover these topics and their trends using a unique dataset consisting of 166 syllabi from AI ethics courses around the world. We do that by using hybrid content analysis which includes the analysis of content combining the algorithmic extraction of coherent and recurrent patterns with human interpretation of identified patterns (Baden Kligler-Vilenchik & Yarchi 2020) (details in Section 2). Topic modelling relies on machine-learning methods for automatically uncovering hidden or latent thematic structures from a textual corpus. The uncovered topics are derived from groups of co-occurring words that are associated with a single subject (or theme) which is referred to as a topic (DiMaggio Nag & Blei 2013). Co-occurring words are words that tend to appear together within the same linguistic context more frequently than one would expect by chance alone. In a nutshell topic models are able to exploit the co-occurrence structure of texts and produce the topics as lists of words that frequently come up together mozilla.org/en/what-we-fund/awards/teaching-responsible-computing-playbook/topics/; or the Wallenberg AI Autonomous Systems and Software Program � Humanities and Society (WASP-HS) program (https://wasp-hs.org/projects/). 935 Javed Nasir Borit Vanh�e Zea Gupta Vinuesa & Qadir within and between documents. Technically such lists of words are probability distributions over words for example garden plants = {0.2: roses 0.4: lilies 0.0: AI 0.3: spring 0.2: autumn}. For example in the context of an AI ethics educational program course designers might use the following words in the course titles: "programming" "economics" "ethics" "machine learning" "AI". However the syllabus might use more frequently the words "law" "principles" "responsibility" "decision" "data" "bias" "security" "discrimination". If we wanted to use topic modelling to uncover the latent topics of this hypothetical program based on how often these most used words would appear together (i.e. co-occur) the automated topic model would group the first four words into one topic and the last four words into a different topic. Because the topic-modelling algorithm does not assign a subject (i.e. a label) to the uncovered topics these two topics would then be manually labelled by a domain expert as the manual interpretation of the subject of a topic is the most straightforward approach of most studies regarding valid interpretation of the resulting topics (Maier et al. 2018). In our example the two topics would most likely be labelled as Responsible design and Data security respectively. Note that the subject of these two topics determined based on the topic modelling analysis is not similar to the one that might be inferred from the titles given to the courses included in this hypothetical program. Thus these topics are latent and they are hidden in the pattern of co-occurring words. Generally speaking topic modelling approaches have been helpful in investigating the key ideas within a set of documents such as articles published in academic journals (e.g. marine sciences journals Syed Borit & Spruit 2018) political texts (Grimmer & Stewart 2013) or data-driven journalism (Rusch et al. 2013). In the domain of AI/Computer Science (CS) topic modelling has been used to identify salient topics discussed in national AI policies (van Berkel et al. 2020) topics prevalent in Internet news related to the fourth industrial revolution (Jang Park & Kim 2018) or topics of research on AI in marketing (Mustak Salminen Pl� & Wirtz 2021). The method has also been used recently in the CS education domain for detecting latent topics and trends in educational technologies (Chen et al. 2020) improving teaching material (Mar�al et al. 2020) or analyzing the curriculum of computer science departments (Matsuda Sekiya & Yamaguchi 2018; Sekiya Matsuda & Yamaguchi 2010). After identifying the hidden topics of AI ethics courses we study the connection between these the discipline of the department(s) giving the course and core pedagogical concepts derived from Bloom�s taxonomy (Krathwohl 2002) which according to Fuller Johnson Ahoniemi Cukierman Hern�n-Losada Jackova Lahtinen Lewis Thompson Riedesel and Others (2007) dominates the field of CS course and assessment design. In addition we look at worldwide geographical trends topic prevalence and topic co-occurrence. After doing that we distil a model of current pedagogical practices in the domain of teaching AI ethics. Our approach to analysing the use of pedagogical concepts in AI ethics courses is unique as in contrast with previous research (e.g. Fiesler et al. 2020; Saltz et al. 2019; Bielefeldt et al. 2019) we anchor our study in well recognized canons from pedagogy science that is Bloom�s taxonomy (Krathwohl 2002) and Biggs� constructive alignment principle (Biggs & Tang 2011) as explained in Section 2.3. Systematized approaches as topic modelling can complement pure human annotation methods as follows. 1) It can reduce noise in processing large amounts of text (Kahneman Sibony & Sunstein 2021). 2) The analysis output generates topics that are identified based 936 Get out of the BAG! Silos in AI Ethics Education on statistical regularities of the words thus the topics match the words something which is difficult to achieve when the analysis is done by hand particularly with large amounts of text. 3) The analysis output provides the relative prevalence of each topic within each item included in the corpus whereas such a fine-grained relation is difficult if not impossible to produce with manual coding. 4) The analysis automates a large part of the process allowing for efficient re-iteration of the data-processing activities. In the long run particularly in a context where the number of AI ethics courses is increasing at a very fast pace this automated process will allow assessing how the contents of the courses are evolving over time with greater speed and quantitative rigour than would otherwise be possible through traditional reviews (Grimmer & Stewart 2013). However as any other method LDA is subject to bias notably arising from as explained in 3.4 the bias originating from the raw data (Gitelman 2013) the generalizations made by the algorithm (Mitchell 1980) and human topic labelling. 2. Methodology 2.1 Data Collection Syllabi Data: In late 2017 a controversy started with a New York Times op-ed declaring the academics community to be "asleep at the wheel" concerning tech ethics (O�Neil 2017). This controversy stoked a trend that motivated researchers to investigate this claim and led to the creation of a community-based public compilation of Tech Ethics curricula in the form of a crowd-sourced Google sheet (Fiesler 2018). This sheet provides a list of tech ethics courses referencing meta-information including course title course instructor course level (undergraduate or graduate) the teaching department university and the possibility to include links towards course descriptions and curricula. At the time of our analysis (January 2021) it contained 259 courses. Since our aim was to analyze the syllabi rather than the metadata we filtered out all the courses that did not have their syllabus publicly available. Then we filtered out all the syllabi that were not in English or that did not relate to AI by systematically removing syllabi that did not contain words such as AI machine learning deep learning or data science. As a result a total of 123 courses were retained from this Google Sheet and the rest were excluded. To make the dataset more global we decided to expand this list which initially contained mostly courses located in the United States of America (US) and Europe. Therefore special focus was given to identifying courses from the under-represented regions. We used a list of search strings along with various country/continent names to find similar courses (see Appendix A). A course was added to the dataset if it was related to AI ethics (as described above) and had an accessible syllabus in English. This activity led us to expand the dataset with 43 additional AI ethics courses. As a result a total of 166 courses were included in the final dataset and were subsequently analyzed. Metadata of the final dataset are shared as online Supplementary material. The syllabi of all these courses were downloaded and included in the analysis. Each course is related to a discipline derived from the teaching department listed on the Fiesler�s list and/or the webpage of the course. We clustered all the departments in four categories. All the departments that were related to engineering computer science informatics etc. were categorized as "computer science". Humanities related departments 937 Javed Nasir Borit Vanh�e Zea Gupta Vinuesa & Qadir such as communication media studies etc. were clustered under "humanities" and the law and policy related departments were grouped under "law". The label "multidisciplinary" was given to courses associated with at least two departments that is it was being taught together by two or more departments. Ethical Considerations: No personal information like emails or contact numbers was retained in the analysis. All the used curricula were publicly available; they were obtained from official websites and were analyzed "as is". In our analysis we ensured that the identity of individual subjects was protected and that there was no risk of harm to the individuals and organizations that made these data publicly available due to the research presented in this paper in accordance with the guidelines by Markham and Buchanan (2012). 2.2 Topic Modelling 2.2.1 Latent Dirichlet Allocation In order to understand better the syllabi in our dataset topic modelling was performed via Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei Ng & Jordan 2003). LDA is a generative probabilistic model widely used in the Natural Language Processing community with applications ranging from document query to text classification and topic modelling. The LDA representation has three levels: corpus document (syllabi text in our case) and topic. The main idea is to represent documents with random mixtures over a set of latent topics which in turn are represented with mixtures over a set of topic probabilities. Further technical details can be found in Blei et al. (2003). Our syllabi were in various formats: PDF web pages (html) word documents and text files. First every syllabus format was turned into a text format. Then standard stopwords detailed in Annex B were removed. Next words were lemmatized using spaCy4 and nouns verbs adjectives and adverbs were kept. Then topics and keywords per topics were extracted from the corpus using Gensim�s5 LDA implementation. The model used was lda_mallet. 2.2.2 Parameter Optimization Topic modeling is sensitive to one hyper-parameter that is the number of considered topics which is critical to optimize. There are both intrinsic and extrinsic measures to optimize the number of topics identified by the LDA. The intrinsic score checks the coherence between generated topics based on the word co-occurrence within the generated corpus. This measure checks the coherence of topics with respect to the documents used for training the model. The extrinsic score uses some external pre-defined corpus to compute the topic coherence. These measures are usually employed where generated topics are evaluated and their coherence is tested with respect to language in general. "u_mass"6 was used for computing the score as an intrinsic measure to compute topic coherence. "u_mass" uses a pairwise score function for a pair of words (wi wj) which is the smoothed conditional log probability log p(wj |wi) over the corpus. 4. https://spacy.io/api/lemmatizer 5. https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/ 6. https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/coherencemodel.html 938 Get out of the BAG! Silos in AI Ethics Education 2.2.3 Labelling Topics The topical structure that characterises the dataset is latent and the probability distributions of words (i.e. topics) are not given a name by the LDA model. When sorted usually the top 10-15 most probable words within each topic are used to describe that topic. The manual interpretation of the subject of a topic is the most straightforward approach of most studies regarding valid interpretation of the resulting topics (Maier et al. 2018). Following the hybrid content analysis method described in Baden et al. (2020) in our study giving a name to each topic was performed by human analysts (i.e. two experts in ethics of AI and pedagogy). First the analysts closely inspected the 15 most probable words from each topic. Second the analysts inspected the intertopic distance map and the titles and content of the syllabi in the dataset that were included by the topic model in that respective topic. Third based on the previous two steps the analysts gave a label to each of the topics. 2.3 Pedagogical Analysis In this study we use Bloom�s taxonomy (Krathwohl 2002) and Biggs� constructive alignment principle (Biggs & Tang 2011) at the core of the pedagogical analysis. Bloom�s taxonomy is a hierarchical model to classify educational learning objectives into levels of cognitive complexity: from basic to increasingly complex knowledge. In its original form (Bloom et al. 1965) the taxonomy consisted of six cognitive levels: Remember  Understand  Apply  Analyze Evaluate and Synthesize. The revised form (Krathwohl 2002) essentially differs in the last level: Create. In course curriculum design the taxonomy is broadly used for devising the Intended Learning Outcomes (ILOs) alternatively called Course Learning Outcomes (CLOs) in some outcome-based education and accreditation regimes (Qadir et al. 2020) and for choosing the right teaching modalities or activity (e.g. lecture group work project work internship). Bloom�s cognitive levels can be summarized as follows. Remember refers to recalling facts terms basic concepts and answers. Understand refers to basic comprehension of facts and ideas. Apply refers to solving problems by using acquired knowledge facts techniques and rules in a different way. Analyze refers to examining and breaking information into parts by identifying motives or causes making inferences and finding evidence to support generalisations. Evaluate refers to presenting and defending opinions by making judgements about information validity of ideas or quality of something based on a set of criteria. Create refers to compiling information together in a different way by combining elements in a new pattern or proposing an alternative solution. As a means for assessing the pedagogical content of a syllabus we used two criteria: the Bloom cognitive level (i.e. what ILOs are to be achieved) as indicated by the syllabus through the verbs used and the teaching modalities (i.e. what teaching activities are to be performed to achieve the ILOs) as mentioned in the syllabus text. For assessing the prevalence of a given Bloom cognitive levels within a syllabus every Bloom cognitive level was related to a set of level-specific verbs taken from Bloom�s taxonomy7 listed in Annex C. Similarly for assessing the prevalence of teaching activities we used the teaching modalities corresponding to each Bloom cognitive level as identified in Wong et al. (2019). The prevalence of a given Bloom cognitive level / teaching modality for a given syllabus was computed 7. https://tips.uark.edu/blooms-taxonomy-verb-chart/ 939 Javed Nasir Borit Vanh�e Zea Gupta Vinuesa & Qadir as the frequency of occurrence of the words related to the considered Bloom cognitive level / teaching modality in the syllabus. For example if five occurrences of Evaluate Bloom cognitive level verbs are identified in a 250-word long curriculum c then the proportion of the Evaluate Bloom cognitive level in c is defined as 5/250 = 0.02. The higher this number the more prevalent is the Bloom cognitive level/ teaching modality. Biggs� constructive alignment principle states that the components in the teaching system especially the teaching methods used and the assessment tasks must be aligned with the learning activities assumed in the intended outcomes (Biggs & Tang 2011). In this study we checked whether the words denoting teaching modalities are aligned with the words denoting a specific Bloom cognitive level (i.e. ILOs); for example if words like lecture seminar test as teaching modalities for Remember Bloom cognitive level co-occur with words like identify indicate list cite define etc. for Remember Bloom cognitive level. 3. Results and Discussion 3.1 Metadata Analysis During the analysis of the meta-information of the 166 courses we categorized the courses based on their level (i.e. undergraduate or graduate) and the department associated with the course (Table 1). Apart from this we also studied the geographical distribution of these courses (Figure 1). A total of 105 universities are part of our dataset with many top universities offering multiple courses. Some syllabi focus on understanding the ethical aspects related to the AI industry while others focus on developing a sense of ethics and responsibility in CS students. 94 syllabi (?56.6%) describe courses offered to undergraduate students 49 syllabi (?29.5%) describe courses offered to graduate students and 23 syllabi (?13.9%) describe course offered to both graduate and undergraduate students. The departmental and geographical breakdown of these courses is shown in Table 1. It can be observed that the instances of the Law department teaching AI ethics are fewer compared to the instances of AI ethics courses taught by the Humanities and Computer Science departments. One potential explanation for this imbalance can be that Law departments do not extensively use AI related words in the title of their courses thus the probability of such courses to be identified by search engines decreases. In addition because of the conceptual differentiation made between ethics and law teachers from Law departments might not consider registering on the tech ethics list from Fiesler (2018). An analysis of the distribution of the departments delivering the courses depending on the continent shows that the continent has an impact on the type of department delivering the course. In Asia most of the AI ethics courses are delivered by the Computer Science departments. In Europe AI ethics courses are offered by the Computer Science departments followed by a multidisicplinary offer and then to a less extent by the Humanities departments. In North America Humanities departments are the main deliverer of AI ethics courses followed by Computer Science and then followed at a large distance by a multidisciplinary offer. In Oceania and South America most of the AI ethics courses are offered by Computer Science departments and to a less extent by the Humanities departments. Further it can be observed that courses delivered by Law departments are only present in North America and multidisciplinary offers are only observed in Europe and North America. Comparing the most represented continents (i.e. Europe and North America) it can be ob940 Get out of the BAG! Silos in AI Ethics Education Table 1: Department-wise disciplinary distribution of AI ethics courses included in our corpus. Multidisciplinary courses are considered to be those courses offered by at least two different departments. Discipline Courses Couses/Continent Intra-continental proportion Computer Science 71 (42.8%) Asia: 9 81.8% Europe: 15 45.5% North America: 43 37.1% Oceania & South America: 4 66.7% Humanities 62 (37.3%) Asia: 2 18.2% Europe: 6 18.2% North America: 52 44.8% Oceania & South America: 2 33.3% Multidisciplinary 28 (16.9%) Asia: 0 0% Europe: 12 36.4% North America: 16 13.8% Oceania & South America: 0 0% Law 5 (3.0%) Asia: 0 0% Europe: 0 0% North America: 5 4.3% Oceania & South America: 0 0% served that whereas the proportion of courses delivered by Computer Science departments is relatively similar the representation of Humanities departments is much more prevalent in North America than in Europe. Likewise multidisciplinary offers are much more represented in Europe than in North America something which is in line with the results of ranking universities across the globe according to their multidisciplinary research which places Europe on the top of this ranking (ranking by World University Research Rankings8). This difference is important because various disciplines might train for various types of professional groups (e.g. engineers managers scientists). A major difference among societies with regards to what department delivers AI ethics education can lead to very different outcomes in terms of the operational capacity societies will have in the future for dealing with AI ethics matters and therefore how AI ethics is to be implemented differently by these societies. For example a society where AI ethics education is delivered mainly by technical departments might foster the emergence of a techno-centric approach to solving AI ethics issues. 8. https://ireg-observatory.org/en/bez-kategorii/world-university-research-rankings-europeexcels-for-multidisciplinary-and-collaborative-research/ 941 Javed Nasir Borit Vanh�e Zea Gupta Vinuesa & Qadir Figure 1: Geographical distribution of countries included in our dataset with total courses count. 3.2 Trends Analysis 3.2.1 Uncovering Topics Following the methodology described in Section 2 LDA was applied to our syllabi dataset. As a result 10 main topics were found within our corpus. The 15 most probable words (i.e. the words with the highest probabilities) together with the semantically attached label for each uncovered latent topic are shown in Table 2. These 10 topics can be grouped into two overarching themes: course administration (5 topics) and course content (5 topics). The intertopic distance map used to label these topics is displayed in Figure 2. The manuallyassigned labels for the five course content topics are as follows: T1 Media & society T4 Philosophy  T6 Responsibility  T8 Data security  and T9 Applications. In order to focus the analysis on the actual course content and avoid being side-tracked by the administrative content the administrative topics were hidden in the following analysis and the remaining topics were normalized. This is possible since the probability distributions of the words identified in administrative-related and content-related topics are statistically distinct. A relevant observation stemming from the analysis of our corpus is that ethics was not identified as a separate topic. It is also worth noting that for every syllabus the LDA model infers the topical decomposition indicating what topics are found in that syllabus and in which proportion. This structure assumes that syllabi are often about several concrete topics rather than about all topics equally. The intertopic distance map for all topics is shown in Figure 2. This two-dimensional topic representation displays the similarity between topics with respect to their word distribution over topics; that is the words and their corresponding probability within the topic. 942 Get out of the BAG!

The topic prevalence indicates how widespread a topic is within the dataset as all topic proportions add up to 100%. In this figure it can be noticed that the topics T6 Responsibility and T8 Data security form a cluster indicating a similar probability distribution over words (i.e. topics whose most probable words are related to some extent). The remaining course content topics T1 Media & society T4 Philosophy  and T9 Applications are isolated from each other suggesting distinct probability distributions over words. Media & society  the most prevalent topic in our corpus relates to syllabi that study the relationship between technology and society. This topic includes numerous concepts related to (social) media (medium Internet digital platform community public) and society (community surveillance public practice culture). This relates to the fact that CS and AI ethics have long been considered socio-technical systems (Jasanoff et al. 2001; Jasanoff 2016; Harris et al. 2018). Philosophy relates to the concepts arising from classic philosophy (philosophy philosophical moral idea) with an interest over (re-)defining basic concepts (robot human future AI machine). Related syllabi often include the study of classic ethical frameworks (e.g. utilitarianism deontology virtue-based ethics) and fiction (movies books). Since Humanities departments propose almost 40% of the syllabi that were included in our corpus 943 Javed Nasir Borit Vanh�e Zea Gupta Vinuesa & Qadir Figure 2: Intertopic distance map showing a two-dimensional representation (via multidimensional scaling) of the topics. The distance between the nodes represents the topic similarity with respect to the distributions of words - closer topics tend to be correlated in the syllabi. many of these syllabi contain more diverse aspects of Philosophy discussing it in more detail than just ethics. Interesting keywords in this topic are robot and machine which may indicate the philosophical concerns addressing ethical and moral issues of considering robots and machines superior to humans (Bostrom 2014) or may indicate the philosophical concerns about machine ethics colloquially known as "programming ethics into the machine" (Anderson & Anderson 2011). Likewise the occurrence of the word robots might also indicate a discussion of the (human) ethics of deploying robots for for example mechanization of work eldercare or war.9 Responsibility relates to the general domain of responsible design and trustworthy AI (High-Level Expert Group 2019) as a form of an engineering practice that is sensitive to social concerns and features aspects of systems such as accountability responsibility and transferability (Dignum 2019) (build user aspect decision people law explain understand impact principle framework cost responsibility). Data security relates to regulatory and technical practices revolving around cybercrime and data management (data datum security legal law report analysis) including indirect regulations and concerns regarding data usage (discrimination bias). Syllabi related to this topic tend to develop advanced legal and regulatory-related contents. Applications relates to concrete technical matters regarding the development of AI systems (application develop AI language open search apply support table). Curricula related to this topic tend to focus on projects and specific technical matters and implementations. Comparing our results with those from Fiesler et al. (2020) who performed a manual analysis of 115 syllabi of mainly US courses from the original set of crowd-sourced "techethics" curricula which we have also partly used our study identified five course content 9. We thank one of the anonymous reviewers for this suggestion. 944 Get out of the BAG! Silos in AI Ethics Education topics compared to 15 topics in this previous study. Topic Philosophy is singled out by both studies. However if grouped under themes some of the 15 topics identified by Fiesler et al. (2020) could be related to some of our topics (e.g. Civic Responsibility & Misinformation and Professional Ethics could relate to Responsibility). In addition our study uncovered the Applications topic which was not identified in the previous work by Fiesler et al. (2020). As discussed in Section 3.2.3 this can be explained by additional courses from outside the US being included in our corpus. As a matter of assessing which of the topics uncovered by the LDA are best aligned with concrete ethical concerns we compared the keywords linked to the identified LDA topics with the contents of the ACM ethics guidelines10 a world-leading ethical guideline. As an evaluation criterion for every topic we summed the number of occurrences of every of its keywords within the ACM ethics guidelines. The results are summarized in Table 3. A total of 200 occurrences of the keywords have been found in the ACM guidelines across all topics. This analysis highlights imbalances between the main approaches for teaching AI ethics and the representativeness of the taught concepts within the ACM ethics guidelines: courses closer to the Responsibility topic seemingly cover a conceptual background much more aligned with the concepts used by this classic ethical guidelines than courses closer to the Applications or Philosophy topics. Table 3: Number of occurrences in the ACM ethics guidelines of the keywords of the various topics uncovered by the LDA. Topic Number of occurrences Responsibility 77 (38.5%) Media & society 37 (18.5%) Data security 37 (18.5%) Philosophy 25 (12.5%) Applications 24 (12%) 3.2.2 Topic Proportion Within Syllabi The heatmap displayed in Figure 3 shows the co-occurrence among topics since some topics tend to be used together in syllabi more frequently than others. This heatmap shows given a dominant topic (set by the label of the row) the distribution of the prevalence of remaining topics. For example when setting the topic Philosophy as dominant 30.4% of their content is related to the topic of Philosophy  leaving 69.6% of the remaining content to be spread to other topics. In this specific case 10% of the content is related to the topic Applications. Note that the numbers on each row do not add up to 100% because a part of the proportion is not displayed due to being allocated to administrative topics. Analyzing co-occurrence highlights potential relations regarding the dominant topic and the prevalence of other topics. It is interesting to note that many of these relationships are asymmetrical. Curricula with Media & society as a dominant topic appear to equally include all other topics whereas syllabi dominated by topics other than Media & society tend to include less even distributions across topics. In particular Data security and to a 10. https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics 945 Javed Nasir Borit Vanh�e Zea Gupta Vinuesa & Qadir Me dia  an d s oci ety App lica tion s Res pon sib ility Phi los oph y Da ta sec uri ty Responsibility (34.39%) Philosophy (30.42%) Applications (30.04%) Data security (27.63%) Media and society (23.94%) Do m in an t T op ic 8.7 9 8.5 6.6 7.8 10 9.9 7 10 6.1 6.2 7.3 8 6.6 8.3 7.4 8.8 8.3 8.2 8.6 Figure 3: Heat map displaying the dominant topic (left) and the remaining average topic proportions (top) for all 166 syllabi. from the corpus - administrative topics are not included and values are normalized between 0 and 1. This indicates the extent to which documents about one main topic relate to the other uncovered topics (i.e. the degree of topic cooccurrence) decreasing from left to right. For example documents that primarily focus on Responsibility also focus on Applications (9%) or Media & society (8.7%). lesser extent Philosophy  tend to be disregarded as secondary topics; whereas Applications and Media & society appear to be particularly co-occurrent secondary topics for syllabi with any dominant topic except for respectively Data security and Philosophy . Regarding more specific relations between topics Philosophy and Responsibility appear to be mutually tied. Syllabi with Philosophy as the dominant topic tend to give high emphasis on Applications whereas syllabi with Applications as the dominant topic tend to give little emphasis to Philosophy and Responsibility . Syllabi with Data security as the dominant topic tend to relate uniformly to other topics with the lowest emphasis over Applications this secondary topic being however the most prevalent for all other dominant topics. Topics with Applications as the dominant topic appear to give high focus to Media & society as secondary topic whereas giving much less emphasis over other topics. Applications is the dominant topic that has the highest discrepancy in terms of co-occurrence with other topics achieving the highest co-occurrence score with Media & society and the lowest cooccurrence score with Responsibility and Philosophy . Overall our results suggest that abstract course contents are connected with specific applications. Such applications are clearly connected with concrete needs of the society where a mapping between the application and the provided solution can be established. These societal needs exhibit more or less evenly-distributed connections with all the other contents. It would be interesting to consider whether other mixtures of topics would bring novel and possibly also innovative insight into AI ethics education. For example syllabi where the dominant topic of Applications co-occurs with topics such as Philosophy or Responsibility 946 Get out of the BAG!

To our knowledge this analysis of what topics in AI ethics are taught across the globe is the first one of this kind. Our results indicate that the prevalence of the five course content topics is balanced in the Asian syllabi with a slight prevalence of the Responsibility topic. European syllabi tend to give more importance to the Applications topic. The North American syllabi shows a significantly greater emphasis on Media & society while the one of Oceania to the Philosophy topic. The figure also indicates that the topic of Data security is not particularly prevalent in any of the continents despite news on this topic being covered in the media on a daily basis across the globe. We have to note here that these results have to be read with caution due to the limitations raised by the skewed dataset as detailed in Section 3.4. 3.2.4 Topics and Disciplines Figure 5 answers the question: "What is the prevalence of the various topics depending on the discipline of the department associated with the syllabus?" This figure exhibits a form of discipline-based specialization: the curricula from computer science tend to cover a balanced mix of the various topics with a possible greater interest given to the Responsibility topic followed closely by the Data security and Applications topics; the curricula associated with multiple departments seem to give more importance to the Philosophy topic; the curricula associated with the humanities department tend to focus more on the Media & society topic; 947 Javed Nasir Borit Vanh�e Zea Gupta Vinuesa & Qadir Me dia  an d s oci ety Phi los oph y Res pon sib ility Da ta sec uri ty App lica tion s Computer Science (71) Humanities (62) Law (5) Multidisciplinary (28) DI SC IP LI NE 0.16 0.19 0.23 0.21 0.21 0.31 0.18 0.2 0.13 0.18 0.085 0.17 0.15 0.45 0.15 0.17 0.31 0.14 0.15 0.22 Figure 5: Distribution of the various topics depending on the discipline.

These results conform with stereotyped expectations of what disciplines teach what topics. However this confirmation shows that communities are still training the learners in silos. This reinforces the critique against the fact that tunnel vision and mismatching values of what is important to learn regarding responsible design which are still being maintained in the current curricular layout (e.g. "tech people thinking about tech activities; law people being hindrances humanities talking about society but being disconnected from technical realities"). 3.2.5 Topics and Pedagogy Next in Figure 6 we answer the question: "What is the prevalence of the various Bloom cognitive levels (Figure 6a) and teaching modalities (Figure 6b) for each given topic?" The Remember Bloom cognitive level is the most prevalent for the Data security topic; the Understand Bloom cognitive level is the most prevalent for the Media & society topic; the Apply Bloom cognitive level is the most prevalent for the Applications topic; the Analyze Bloom cognitive level is not the most prevalent for any topic; the Evaluate Bloom cognitive level is the most prevalent for the Philosophy topic; and the Create Bloom cognitive level is the most prevalent for the Responsibility topic. A per-topic analysis matches a-priori expectations one may have when relating a topic to a Bloom cognitive level: Media & society is an activity driven towards understanding society and its mechanisms within the context of AI tech development; Philosophy focuses on evaluating systems; Responsibility gives more emphasis on the responsible design of systems; Data security gives more emphasis on memorizing the many laws and rules that apply in various contexts while the Applications topic is more centered on practical aspects. The Apply teaching modalities are the most prevalent for the Media & society topic; the Evaluate teaching modalities are the most prevalent for the Philosophy topic; the Analyze 948 Get out of the BAG!

Each row is normalized to 1. teaching modalities are the most prevalent for the Responsibility topic; the Apply teaching modalities are the most prevalent for the Data security topic; the Understand teaching modalities are the most prevalent for the Applications topic. In this case the distribution of the prevalence of the various teaching modalities is surprising and more difficult to explain with intuitions (e.g. why is there so little emphasis on the Apply teaching modalities for the Applications topic? Why is there so much emphasis on Create and Apply teaching modalities for the Data security topic?). A cross-comparison between the Bloom cognitive levels and teaching modalities per topic highlights a disalignment between claimed learning objectives and pedagogical methods put in place except for the Philosophy topic. For instance syllabi with high prevalence on Data security tend to emphasize on developing knowledge about rules while often extensively relying on projectoriented pedagogic activities; curricula with high prevalence on Applications tend to rely relatively extensively on lecture and group discussions even though the score on the Apply Bloom cognitive level is higher than of the other ones. A very interesting insight arises when crossing these analyses at an overall level: the topic to be taught appears to be a strongly differentiating factor with regards to the Bloom cognitive level and teaching modalities. In other words these results match the intuition that in current curricula teaching different topics calls for teaching at different Bloom cognitive levels and with different teaching modalities. In turn this suggests a topic-centered specialization of ILOs and teaching activities. On a separate note a cross-comparison of the average frequency of the Bloom cognitive level-related words across the syllabi highlights that these levels are used relatively balanced. This result contrasts with the one from Fiesler et al. (2020) who identified only two main categories of ILOs: recognize ethical issues and apply rules & create solutions. 949 Javed Nasir Borit Vanh�e Zea Gupta Vinuesa & Qadir Cre ate Ev alu ate An aly ze Ap ply Un de rst an d Re me mb er BLOOM LEVEL Asia (11) Europe (36) North America (116) Oceania (5) C O N TI N EN T 0.25 0.057 0.2 0.22 0.12 0.16 0.24 0.073 0.2 0.24 0.098 0.15 0.21 0.1 0.13 0.25 0.13 0.18 0.36 0.12 0.16 0.2 0.078 0.085 (a) Cre ate _m od Eva lua te_ mo d An aly ze_ mo d Ap ply _m od Un de rst and _m od Re me mb er_ mo d Asia (11) Europe (36) North America (116) Oceania (5) CO N TI N EN T 0.28 0.15 0.034 0.051 0.15 0.33 0.2 0.14 0.028 0.049 0.3 0.27 0.31 0.13 0.085 0.047 0.25 0.17 0.15 0.03 0.058 0.037 0.36 0.37 TEACHING MODALITY (b) Figure 7: Breakdown of curricula from a given region into (a) Bloom cognitive levels and (b) teaching modalities. Each row is normalized to 1. 3.2.6 Pedagogy and Continents Figure 7 addresses the question: "What is the prevalence of the various Bloom cognitive levels (Figure 7a) and various teaching modalities (Figure 7b) in the curricula of each continent?". The Create and Apply Bloom cognitive levels appear to be most prevalent in all regions with Oceania putting a stronger emphasis on the former. When it comes to teaching modalities there are differences among continents: the Remember modalities are prevalent in Asia and Oceania (with the latter also emphasising the Understand modalities). Understand modalities are more prevalent in Europe and Create modalities are prevalent in North America. The distribution of the prevalence over the various Bloom cognitive levels and teaching modalities is relatively the same across continents possibly indicating a common global practice. Crossing Figure 7a and Figure 7b it seems that there is a misalignment between ILOs and teaching modalities at continent level (e.g. there is no correspondence between Apply ILOs and Apply teaching modalities). In particular there are recurrent misalignments across continents between Bloom cognitive level and Bloom teaching modalities: the prevalence of the Apply Bloom cognitive level ILOs are overrepresented with regards to the prevalence of the Apply teaching modalities; and the prevalence of the Understand Bloom cognitive level ILOs are underrepresented with regards to the prevalence of the Understand teaching modalities. 3.2.7 Pedagogy and Discipline Figure 8 answers the question: "What differentiates the syllabus from different departments in its formulation for each Bloom cognitive levels (Figure 8a) and teaching modalities (Figure 8b)?"

However while this seems to be right at ILOs level when looking at teaching modalities there is a discrepancy with Remember modalities dominating this curriculum. One-third of the syllabi giving prevalence to the Remember Bloom cognitive level and Understand Bloom cognitive level overlaps with the curricula of the syllabi offered by the Humanities department and Law department respectively. Nevertheless also within these departments there is a discrepancy regarding the alignment of ILOs and teaching modalities. At ILOs level these results seem to confirm the stereotype that computer scientists are solution-oriented while those coming from humanities and law focus most on remembering and basic comprehension of facts terms and concepts. One-third of the syllabi related to the Evaluate Bloom cognitive level overlaps with the syllabi offered by multiple departments. This might indicate that in such syllabi the emphasis is put on presenting and defending opinions by making judgements based on a set of criteria thus showing the value of syllabi taught by a multidisciplinary team in comparison with a mono-disciplinary one. However the discrepancy between ILOs and teaching modalities described above plagues these too. 951 Javed Nasir Borit Vanh�e Zea Gupta Vinuesa & Qadir 3.3 Meta-Synthesis A model of how AI ethics is taught across the world can be derived from a meta-synthesis of the results presented above11. This model consists of three general approaches each of these approaches relating specific Bloom cognitive levels course content topics and disciplines associated with a syllabus as summarized in Table 4. We call this model BAG: Build Assess and Govern. The first general approach labelled "Build" focuses on teaching the ability to design trustworthy technical solutions. The second labelled "Assess" focuses on teaching the ability of making judgements based on finding evidence anchored in fundamental principles of society. The third approach labelled "Govern" focuses on teaching the core of the guiding terms and concepts needed to protect the stakeholders impacted by technical solutions. Despite a general consensus on the fact that ethical and responsible AI design is intrinsically an interdisciplinary matter (Dignum 2019 2021) the BAG model highlights that the subject matter of ethics is still visibly taught in silos: specific topics specific disciplines specific ability levels. By teaching in silos we are seeding the issues we are facing today thus being in the danger of perpetuating in the future the limited practices of the present. Tomorrow�s engineers are now trained with a focus on design but with limited insight into the legality or social desirability of their systems. Tomorrow�s lawyers are now trained to see the risks and apply rules with only minimal training on pragmatically weighting these risks over social benefits. Tomorrow�s social scientists are now trained to see how AI can influence the dynamics of society with only limited oversight on actual technical and engineering intricacies that can drive design decisions. This development in silos highlights an important issue that calls for action as a community if we want future generations to work together rather than against each other and to prevent society from becoming locked into undesirable path dependencies. Besides highlighting a problem the BAG model also offers a potential solution for alleviating the development in silos within the limited time and resources for training AI ethics learners. This solution consists of developing hybrid ethics courses that blend: 11. This table and model were established based on a cross-analysis of the results from the previous sections and tables & figures. The relation between topics and disciplines is introduced in Section 3.2.3 showing that Computer Science syllabi tend to lean towards the Responsibility topic Law syllabi towards the Data security topic Humanities syllabi towards the Media & society topic and Multidisciplinary syllabi towards the Philosophy topic. The relation between topics and Bloom cognitive level is identified in Section 3.2.5 notably relating the Responsibility topic and to a lesser degree the Applications topic to the Apply and Create Bloom cognitive levels; the Philosophy topic to the Evaluate Bloom cognitive level; the Media & society and Data security topics to the Understand and Remember Bloom cognitive levels. The Applications topic is shown to be balanced across all Bloom cognitive levels. The Analyze Bloom cognitive level is not favored by any particular topic. Instead of removing it from the model we decided to associate it with the Evaluate Bloom cognitive level as analysis skills are the foundation of evaluation skills. The Build Assess and Govern labels were associated with each of these clusters based on the general behavior and type of professional activity that can be related to the matched topics disciplines and Bloom cognitive level. Syllabi training computing-scientists focused on technical topics growing creative and applicative skills thematically relate to an ethical Build ing of AI systems. Multidiscplinary syllabi focused on philosophical and applicative topics growing analytical and evaluative skills thematically relate to an ethical Assessment of AI systems. Syllabi training humanities and law students focused on knowing / understanding the issues of media society and data-security thematically relate to an ethical Government of AI systems. 952 Get out of the BAG! Silos in AI Ethics Education Table 4: A meta-synthesis of the approaches for teaching tech ethics: the BAG model (Build Assess Govern). The Applications topic bridges both the Build and the Assess teaching approaches. Build Assess Govern Topic Responsibility  Philosophy  Applications Media & society Applications Data security Discipline Computer Science Multidisciplinary Humanities & Law Bloom cognitive level Create Apply Evaluate Analyze Understand  Remember 1) a generalist ethics module taught in a multi/interdisciplinary way (e.g. including philosophy accountability inequality environmental sustainability) with 2) a domain/professionspecific ethics module taught by a disciplinary expert (e.g. AI designer engineering law medical practice journalism). By covering in a balanced way all of the Bloom cognitive levels (see Figure 8a) multidisciplinary courses have the potential to develop a relatively complete array of cognitive abilities in their learner compared with courses that utilize fewer Bloom cognitive levels. This because Bloom�s taxonomy is based on a specific hierarchy of learning levels with each lower level being a vital part of moving to the next level. Such multi/interdisciplinary courses would be enriched with domain/profession-specific abilities that best match the future job of the learner. Thus for example data analysts taught in a teaching-and-learning system that follows our proposed solution would develop the required specific technical skills augmented with a broad spectrum of cognitive abilities allowing them to meaningfully interact with a large array of stakeholders from different domains (e.g. diverse group of users data-protection authorities legal departments). The teaching and learning approach proposed here enables all the involved parties to create a minimal basis for the joint understanding of the global value of ethics and the interests of the other parties. The challenges of today and tomorrow do not come nicely arranged in disciplinary silos. Practitioners interested in renewing their practices could use the BAG model to identify where they position themselves relative to the three teaching approaches and try to cross topic bridges (e.g. Data security + Responsibility) Bloom cognitive level bridges (e.g. Remember + Apply) or discipline bridges (e.g. Humanities + Computer Science). As a matter of removing these silos and getting out of the BAG model it seems relevant to strive for a form of holistic training removing disciplinary topic-oriented and Bloom cognitive levels barriers. There are ways to abandon the BAG paradigm progressively. One could seek to promote a shift towards a shared vocabulary (Raji et al. 2021). Further action could seek a more balanced distribution of the various topics being taught in a given course. As such as described in Section 3.2.2 courses related with Media & society as a dominant topic appear to be suited examples for balancing this distribution whereas existing curricula related with Applications appear to be much more imbalanced. Whereas assessing whether the reason for such imbalance is beyond the scope of this paper (e.g. is it inherently more difficult to teach about philosophy in application-driven courses?) further 953 Javed Nasir Borit Vanh�e Zea Gupta Vinuesa & Qadir exploration of this direction can offer means for reducing the prevalence of disciplinary silos. This being said it must be noted that some might argue that in some cases there could be justifications for deliberately having an imbalanced distribution of topics (e.g. a strong need for specialization of the students) or that such a balance may entail sacrificing depth. Such arguments have been formulated previously in the context of the rise of multi- and interdisciplinary education (e.g. Pirrie Hamilton & Wilson 1999; Benson & Miller 1982) with significant educational and research effort put in demonstrating one perspective or the other and in providing educational tools and environments that would foster harmonized development of either approach. As expressed in Holley (2017) we believe that our proposal of a more balanced distribution of the various topics in a given course does not diminish the role of specialization in education but rather �acknowledges that knowledge is unbounded and potential discoveries lie outside compartmentalized structures". This perspective is shared by recent scholarships regarding interdisciplinary AI ethics education (Borenstein & Howard 2021) and several mixed-faculty courses are considered to be successful by experts12. 3.4 Limitations of the Study The main limitation of this study arises from the focus of analysis that is the course syllabi. Such texts do not necessarily faithfully represent what goes on in the classroom13. However using syllabi as a proxy for the classroom activity is the best option in the case of large scale systematic assessment of what is taught in specific courses. By relying on an LDA analysis this study is bound by similar limitations as data-centered analysis. First limitations can be raised by the data collection process as this can be incomplete (thus it might not a representative sample) and unevenly distributed. Notably there is an over-representation of North American syllabi and an under-representation of law syllabi. Such incompleteness and uneven distribution is partly due to the fact that Fiesler�s form is open access (Fiesler 2018) and its coverage is sensitive to whether course organizers are aware of this list and willing to contribute to it. Most probably STEM science technology engineering and mathematics (STEM) teachers working with ethics are the most likely exposed to this list and feel the most legitimate to contribute to it. As a matter of alleviating this limitation we put considerable effort into expanding the dataset towards the inclusion of courses from under-represented regions. Despite the addition of 43 courses the systematic inclusion of courses beyond English-speaking countries has proven to be difficult as AI ethics curricula are not easily accessible in English or are behind Learning Management Systems only accessible internally such as Canvas or Blackboard (this is true even for courses in English-speaking countries). Thus the current dataset is close to the most comprehensive that could have been obtained considering this limitation. Second limitations can be raised by the analysis tool itself. Despite being a central pillar of automated topic modelling LDA is not exempt from simplifications and approximations that can misguide further interpretation. The model used by the LDA is based on a statistical generative approximation of the corpus turned into �bags of words� thus 12. These are two examples of such courses: http://www.cs.utah.edu/~suresh/courses/ethics.html https://data.berkeley.edu/data-c104-fall-2020-syllabus. We thank one of the anonymous reviewers for these examples. 13. We thank one of the anonymous reviewers for this reflection. 954 Get out of the BAG! Silos in AI Ethics Education losing the information about the structure of the text (e.g. negations irony citations). The LDA focuses on identifying discriminating keywords and best-differentiated topics without displaying common words (e.g. ethics in the case of our corpus) and regarding correlations between topics (Blei et al. 2003; Blei & Lafferty 2007). Then computing the topics and keywords relies on an approximated computing process with a possibility of reaching a suboptimal local optimum (i.e. another combination of keywords could have been found that is statistically more plausible or to better divide the topics). Last limitations can be raised by the interpretation of the results notably how topics were labelled and how inferences were made based on the obtained prevalence. This work has been performed manually and as such it involved the risk of being subjective. Following the practices established in qualitative studies (Barbour 2001) and in LDA analysis (Baden et al. 2020) we attempted to mitigate this risk by relying on two independent researchers for establishing labels and making inferences. These activities were performed with great caution thorough discussions and assuming the possibility of misrepresentations arising from the data and the analysis. 4. Conclusions Anchored in well recognized canons from pedagogy science i.e. Bloom�s taxonomy (Krathwohl 2002) and Biggs� constructive alignment principle (Biggs & Tang 2011) this article explores where what and how tech ethics are currently being taught by applying advanced statistical tools namely a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) analysis followed by a metasynthesis. In contrast to previous related studies our analysis has a wide disciplinary scope (AI ethics) a broad geographical coverage (global level) it includes courses at both undergraduate and graduate levels it relies on automated statistical methods and it is based on a solid pedagogy approach. The analysis conducted in this study indicates that there are numerous significant misalignments between the Intended Learning Outcomes (ILOs) and teaching modalities put in place for training these ILOs (e.g. using lectures for training towards Apply Bloom cognitive level skills or using projects for Remember -heavy topics). Furthermore the analysis highlights the presence of three silos related to the pedagogy strategies for teaching tech ethics along a model which we call BAG (Build Assess Govern). The Build teaching strategy focuses on the topics responsible design engineering and technical aspects creative and application skills. The Assess learning approach generally taught by a multidisciplinary team focuses on developing evaluation and analysis skills through studies of philosophical topics and concrete applications. The Govern teaching approach generally delivered by Humanities and Law departments focuses on developing general knowledge and understanding of the Data security and Media & society topics. Although we contributed to enrich the curricula dataset towards higher geographical coverage (11 courses from Asia 33 from Europe 116 courses from North American universities and 6 from other regions) the dataset is still skewed towards the US. As a result topics that are prevalent in less represented regions (e.g. Asia Oceania) could have been overlooked by the LDA. Enriching the dataset with more diverse curricula is important in understanding how AI ethics is taught in various regions around the globe as ethical behaviour can mean different things in different demographics. As a future work we intend to supplement our 955 Javed Nasir Borit Vanh�e Zea Gupta Vinuesa & Qadir database with courses from under-represented regions (e.g. Africa South America Asia) and invite fellow colleagues to help us in this endeavour. The findings of this study highlight that current curricula perpetuate disciplinary mindsets and communities which is suboptimal for the seamless design of systems that best serve society. As a community such findings demonstrate an urge for concrete actions to be taken by higher-education institutions so that the engineers lawmakers designers policymakers and AI users can work together rather than against each other. It is important to challenge teaching practitioners and program coordinators so that the usual procedures are re-evaluated. We hope that this will result in expanding the pre-established methodologies beyond the confines of traditional biases and stereotypes in teaching in particular when it comes to what disciplines should be taught and how. This study proposes one way to address this problem through a generic-to-specific hybrid teaching and learning approach as a possible solution for best connecting the various communities within a shared understanding of the value of AI ethics.

Search Strategy for Expanding the Initial Dataset In order to extend the dataset we used various search terms that were related to AI Ethics education. In order to ensure Google gives good results irrespective of the region we are searching from a VPN was used to simulate searches from different regions. A full list of search terms along with the regions and VPNs used is included in Table 5. Furthermore when considering a course for inclusion within our dataset the contents of the syllabi were checked to make sure it is in line with our aims for this study. As a result we manually ensured that terms related to AI like data science machine learning artificial intelligence deep learning etc. were among the central themes of the curricula. 956 Get out of the BAG!

However most of the scientific publications do not differentiate between the components of a traceability system and those who do to some degree use inconsistent terminology and definitions. This weakens the analysis and the conclusions and it can lead to misunderstanding in relation to what a traceability system is what the components are and how system functionality can be improved. Scope and approach: This paper provides a structure for describing and analyzing a traceability system and emphasizes the difference between the system mechanisms as opposed to the attributes of the units that are traced. The basis for the classification outlined in this article is practical experience from traceability system implementations in the food industry and participation in international standardization processes relating to food traceability. The references and the authors� experience are from the food sector but the component description is likely to be relevant and applicable to any product traceability system in a supply chain. �Traceability system� is used as a generic term in this article encompassing the principles practices and standards needed to achieve traceability of food products regardless of how these are implemented. In practice in the food industry most traceability systems are computerized and they are implemented through extensive use of information and communications technology (ICT) but in principle a traceability system could be manual and paper-based (as was indeed common practice only a few years ago) and the components hierarchy outlined in this article would still be applicable. Key findings and conclusions: This paper identifies the general components of a traceability system to be the identification of the units under consideration the recording of the joining and splitting of these units as they move through the supply chain (the transformations) and the recording of the unit attributes. The distinction between the different components is particularly important when describing and comparing traceability systems and when recommending improvements. In both these cases the respective components need to be considered separately. 1. Introduction The term �traceability� is currently used more than ever both in the food industry and in the production industry in general. There are many large research and technical development (RTD) initiatives and projects relating to (food) product traceability on company national and international level. There are food traceability requirements in international legislation (e.g. the European Union (EU): General Good Law (European Commisssion 2002)) and in national legislation (e.g. the United States: FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (FDA 2017)) as well as in intra-company contracts and there is an ever increasing array of electronic systems for handling traceability available on the market (Espi�eira & Santaclara 2016). This trend is also reflected in the media articles and scientific publications about food traceability (see Fig. 1). However many of these scientific publications use inconsistent terminology and definitions not only when it comes to traceability in itself but also to traceability-related terms and concepts and to the components of a traceability system (Borit & Olsen 2016; JansenVullers van Dorp & Beulens 2003; Olsen & Borit 2013). This article addresses this last issue and provides a general description of the components of a traceability system on overall level. This article is partly intended as a suggested glossary for how to name and refer to components of a traceability system especially in reports and in scientific articles where a certain level of consistency and rigour is required. An important application of this article is to enable systematic study and classification of the components of specific traceability https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tifs.2018.05.004 Received 26 June 2017; Received in revised form 22 December 2017; Accepted 1 May 2018 ?

T systems so that the defining features are highlighted and the system in question can be compared to - and to some degree benchmarked against other similar systems. Benchmarking traceability systems is relevant when considering costs and benefits in relation to various options when comparing systems in different organizations or in different parts of the same organization and when analysing strengths weaknesses opportunities and threats related to product traceability or lack thereof. The basis for the classification outlined in this article is practical experience from traceability system implementations in the food industry and participation in international standardization processes relating to food traceability. For more than 20 years the first author has worked with traceability systems and implementations in various sectors of the food industry including meat chicken honey mineral water and seafood. During this time the first author has participated in the development of the general food traceability standard ISO 22005 (ISO 2007) led the development of the seafood traceability standards ISO 12875 (ISO 2011a) and ISO 12877 (ISO 2011b) and together with the co-author is participating in the ongoing development of ISO 22095 (ISO 2017). The terminology used and the concepts and practices outlined in this article are in line with common practice in the food industry and also in line with the indicated standards. 2. Traceability and traceable resource units Before going into details on what the components of a traceability system are we need to define what traceability is (Section 2.1) and we need to define what it is we are tracing (Section 2.2). 2.1. Definition of traceability There are numerous definitions of (food product) traceability in international regulations (e.g. EU Regulation 178/2002) and standards (e.g. ISO 22005) as well as in some scientific articles (e.g. (Moe 1998)). The authors have published a comprehensive analysis of definitions of traceability found in legislation in international standards in some dictionaries and also the most cited standalone definition formulated in a scientific article according to a systematic literature review of the field of food traceability (Olsen & Borit 2013). As demonstrated in this previous research most of these definitions suffer from recursion i.e. defining �traceability� as �the ability to trace� without defining �to trace� or from not being consistent with common usage i.e. focusing on only some properties or only on part of the supply chain. After describing and analyzing in details the problems identified with all these definitions the authors have proposed an improved definition which is used as basis for the analysis and discussion here. Thus traceability is defined as �the ability to access any or all information relating to that which is under consideration throughout its entire life cycle by means of recorded identifications� (Olsen & Borit 2013). The content of this current article does not depend on that particular definition; the components of a traceability system are the same regardless of which definition is chosen. 2.2. Definition of Traceable Resource Unit (TRU) In this article we refer to �that which is under consideration� in the traceability definition as a Traceable Resource Unit (TRU). This is a well-established general term used in many scientific articles (Kelepouris Pramatari & Doukidis 2007; Kim Fox & Gruninger 1995; Pizzuti Mirabelli Sanz-Bobi & Gom�z-Gonzal�z 2014). As far as the traceability system is concerned a TRU can be any traceable object and typically it is a trade unit (e.g. a case a bag a bottle or a box) a logistic unit (e.g. a pallet or a container) or a production unit (i.e. a lot or batch). An important distinction is between internal units which are defined by the company in question (e.g. production lots or batches) and normally identified using company-specific internal codes that are not generally understood outside the Food Business Operator (FBO) as opposed to trade units which pass between companies and have to be identified in a way that both trading partners can understand (Karlsen Olsen & Donnelly 2010; Thakur Martens & Hurburgh 2011). There is also often a hierarchy of TRUs in that a box may be part of a pallet that in turn may be part of a container and all these are considered to be TRUs in their own right. The main focus in this article is to analyze the components of a traceability system thus we will not go into further detail when it comes to TRU types. 3. Components of a traceability system The definition above refers to �recorded identifications� so in a traceability system there must be some way of identifying the TRUs it refers to �throughout its entire life cycle� so there must be some way of keeping track of TRU relationships as they move through the supply chain and it refers to �any or all information relating to that which is under consideration� so there must be some way of recording TRU attributes. Thus we can broadly identify the components of a traceability system to be as follows: 1. A mechanism for identifying TRUs (Section 3.1); 2. A mechanism for documenting transformations i.e. connections between TRUs (Section 3.2); 3. A mechanism for recording the attributes of the TRUs (Section 3.3). 3.1. A mechanism for identifying TRUs When choosing how to identify TRUs we have to choose the identifier code type and structure (Section 3.1.1) we have to make choices with respect to granularity and uniqueness of the code (Section 3.1.2) and we have to find a way to associate the identifier with the TRU in question (Section 3.1.3). 3.1.1. Identifier code type and structure When choosing a code or structure for the identifier there are many options. Most often the TRU identifier is numeric or alphanumeric and the length can vary from a few characters (used for internal batch identification) to a couple of hundred (used for example for electronic product identification where the code is read from a computer chip associated with the TRU). The code can be a simple sequential code with no inherent structure (e.g. batch number 1 is produced on day number 1) or it can have a structure where different parts of the code have different meanings. On global level the international non-profit organization GS1 defines codes and number series to avoid accidental re-use of numbers (Stor�y Thakur & Olsen 2013). GS1 also defines how the numbers can be printed in various machine-readable formats including bar-codes. An example of a rather advanced and lengthy code for TRU identification is indicated in Table 1. Fig. 1. Scientific articles on food traceability published in the Scopus database in the period 1979�2016 (search term: �food traceability�; search date: 23.06.2017). P. Olsen M. Borit Trends in Food Science & Technology 77 (2018) 143�149 144 In practice most codes used in the food industry (and in the production industry in general) are shorter and simpler than this and contain fewer fields. For instance the fields �Header� �Filter� and �Partition� are only relevant if several different types of codes use the same structure �Company prefix� is only needed for codes that will be used outside the organization in question and �Serial number� is only used if each TRU has a unique identifier (as opposed to several TRUs sharing the same identifier see Section 3.1.2). Simpler and shorter codes for TRU identification are commonly used in the food industry; the SGTIN code was selected as an example because it is fairly comprehensive and the fields in the shorter codes will often be a subset of the fields outlined in Table 1. There are numerous schemes and standards describing different types of code structures that can be used and details on this could warrant a whole article in itself. For traceability purposes the uniqueness and granularity of the code are the most important attributes as explained below. 3.1.2. Identifier uniqueness and granularity For an identifier to serve as intended it must be unique within the context where it is used (Regattieri Gamberi & Manzini 2007; Senneset For�s & Fremme 2007; Stor�y et al. 2013). The context can be the individual production facility the parent company the supply chain nationally or globally. GS1 issues codes that are unique on national or global level and most trading standards refer to these codes including at point of sale to the consumer where Global Trade Item Number (GTIN) codes are widely used. GS1 offers a wide range of codes. Some of these codes are meant for many TRUs (e.g. all bottles of a certain brand from a given producer will have the same GTIN code) whereas some are meant to be used on only one TRU. A one-to-many relationship between codes and TRUs is quite common in the food industry when one single code (unique within a context) is found on many TRUs. This happens for example when the code describes a production run or production batch that results in many TRUs. In the traceability system this is problematic because the code in question does not point to one and only one TRU. Thus as far as the traceability system is concerned the TRUs are indistinguishable. In the real world the TRUs are of course not indistinguishable and while they may initially share many properties (e.g. origin location environmental attributes) they are physically separate entities and may have different paths through the supply chain. With the advent of longer codes and media that can carry longer codes (RFID chips in particular) one-to-one relationships between codes and TRUs are becoming more common (Dabbene Gay & Tortia 2016). This is similar for example to the relationship between cars and license plate numbers or between people and social security numbers in that in a given context there is only one unit (TRU in our case) with a given code. A one-to-one relationship between codes and TRUs allows for a more powerful traceability system. As the code remains associated with the TRU new attributes of the TRU can be linked to the unique code in the traceability system. If a one-to-one relationship between codes and TRUs does not exist it is difficult to record attribute values for the TRU in question in the system as the code in question is shared by several TRUs whereas the attribute value in question may not be shared by all of them (e.g. exact location at a given date and time). To illustrate what the problem is in the absence of a one-to-one relationship between codes and TRUs if a red and a green truck both transported TRUs with identical codes from production to storage and unloaded them there it would be impossible to identify which TRU came from the red truck and which came from the green truck. It could be that the cooling system on the red truck broke down and the TRUs in that truck were subjected to high temperature for a significant time. If the red truck and the green truck deliver their TRUs to the same recipient after delivery the TRUs that came from the red truck can no longer be distinguished from the ones that came from the green truck and later it would be impossible to find out what route the TRUs took toTa bl e 1 A co de st ru ct ur e ex am pl e fr om th e 96 bi t G S1 Se ri al iz ed G lo ba l Tr ad e Id en ti fi ca ti on (S G TI N ) co de us ed fo r el ec tr on ic id en ti fi ca ti on of pr od uc ts an d bu si ne ss -t obu si ne ss tr an sa ct io ns .

Even if the truck drivers wanted to record information pertaining to the TRUs in their truck they could not do so because there was no identifier that the recording could be linked to. In this context granularity refers to the amount of product referred to by the identifier (Bollen Riden & Cox 2007; Karlsen Dreyer Olsen & Elvevoll 2012). Fine granularity means that an identifier refers to a relatively small amount of product; coarse granularity is the opposite. For the food business operator (FBO) this is a trade-off; fine granularity means more work and more cost related to data recording and physical separation of batches but it also means more accurate traceability and a smaller amount to recall if anything should happen. 3.1.3. Association of identifier to TRU There are various ways to associate an identifier with a TRU. The most common is through some sort of physical marking directly on the TRU or on its label (Dabbene Gay & Tortia 2014). Part of the marking is normally in plain text and readable by humans but it is often supplemented by machine-readable codes such as barcodes or Quick Response (QR) codes. In business-to-business transactions radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology is also increasingly used (Badia-Melis Mishra & Ruiz-Garc�a 2015; Costa et al. 2013) with the chip either physically attached to the TRU or to the packaging that the TRU is in (e.g. box). Passive RFID tags require no battery and are becoming very cheap but a number of technical challenges (e.g. sensitivity to deployment environment) still needs to be overcome in order to harness the full potential of this technology (Bolic Simplot-Ryl & Stojmenovic 2010). In addition this type of tag normally only carries a pre-defined code. Active RFID tags use a battery and can also record environmental parameters (e.g. temperature pressure humidity Global Positioning System (GPS) location etc.) but they are more expensive. The identifier may also be associated with the TRU indirectly for instance when a computerized traceability system keeps track of exact TRU location (e.g. on a conveyor belt) and the identifier is known in the IT system but it is not physically associated with the TRU in any way. 3.2. A mechanism for documenting transformations Once we have selected what type of identifier to use and we have found a way to associate the identifier to the TRU we need to document what happens to the TRU as it moves through the supply chain. The supply chain for food products is often long and complex and TRUs do not necessarily last long; they are constantly split up or joined together with other TRUs. These splits and joins are referred to as transformations and the ability to document the sequence of transformations is one of the most important function of the traceability system (Dillon & Derrick 2004; Olsen & Aschan 2010). 3.2.1. Types of transformations A transformation is an instant or a duration of time where at a given location a process uses a set of inputs (TRUs) to generate outputs (new TRUs). Examples of simple transformations can be (Dillon & Derrick 2004; Donnelly Karlsen & Olsen 2009; Thakur & Hurburgh 2009): � �one input TRU one output TRU� where only one input TRU is used to produce one output TRU (e.g. one whole fish (input TRU) is filleted and placed alone in a single fish box (output TRU)); � �merging of input TRUs� where a number of input TRUs are used in (mixed) conjunction to produce one output TRU (e.g. two different feed bags (several input TRUs) are poured into one feed silo (one output TRU)); � �splitting of output TRUs� where one input TRU is used as basis for production of a number of output TRUs (e.g. one meat producing animal (one input TRU) are cut into numerous fillets that are placed in different boxes (several output TRUs)). In practice the actual transformations in a supply chain are often a complex mixture of the simple types indicated above and there is often a very large number of transformations in a given chain involving many suppliers and many TRUs. Software implementations of traceability systems often contain the functionality for visualizing the sequence of transformations as a directed graph referred to as a traceability tree. An example of such a graph is depicted in Fig. 2. The nodes are TRUs the weights are indicated below the nodes and the incoming and outgoing amounts (percentages) from and to the respective processes are indicated on the vertices. As an illustration the diagram indicates that 600 kg of TRU 111 was combined with 900 kg of TRU 133 to make TRU 222. The 1500 kg TRU 222 in turn went into TRU 311 (600 kg) TRU 322 (300 kg) and TRU 333 (600 kg). For a given TRU the TRUs that was used to produce it is commonly referred to as �the parent TRUs� and the joint collection of all parent TRUs grandparent TRUs etc. going all the way back to the start of the chain are referred to as �the ancestor TRUs� or just �the ancestors�. Thus the ancestors of TRU 333 are TRUs 222 111 133 244 and 144. For a given TRU the TRUs that it produced is commonly referred to as �the child TRUs� and the joint collection of all child TRUs grandchild TRUs etc. going all the way forward to the end of the chain are referred to as �the progeny TRUs� or just �the progeny�. Thus the progeny of TRU 244 are TRUs 333 422 444 344 and 433. Knowing the ancestors and progeny is particularly relevant if some sort of contamination is identified in the TRU in question; the ancestors must be examined to identify where the contamination originated from and thus help identify which other TRUs might be contaminated and the progeny are considered contaminated and must be recalled. This traceability tree is very simplified with four clearly defined stages of production (indicated by the first digit of the TRU identifier) only one interchangeable type of raw material/product 100% constant yield (no loss) a very short chain and very few nodes. In general a real life traceability tree for an actual supply chain will be a lot bigger and a lot more complicated. Also unless the FBOs are vertically integrated through the supply chain and share information freely it may not be possible for anyone to visualize the entire traceability tree but respective subsets of the tree can be visualized in each company in the supply chain. 3.2.2. Direct or indirect recording of transformations Recording of a transformation is simplest when we know the input TRUs identifiers and the output TRUs identifiers; then the relationship between inputs and outputs can be recorded directly. However in many processes the details of the transformation are not explicitly known either because of undocumented mixing or because data are not recorded. An example of undocumented mixing is when feedbags are added to a non-empty feed silo and feed from that silo is used as input Fig. 2. An example of a traceability tree with four processing stages. P. Olsen M. Borit Trends in Food Science & Technology 77 (2018) 143�149 146 into a process (for more examples see (Skoglund & Dejmek 2007)). A transformation happens in the silo from numerous feedbag inputs to numerous �feed extracted from the silo� outputs but even if we know the input and output TRUs identifiers we do not know the details of the transformation. What normally happens is that the silo is emptied regularly and then we can identify a transformation from all the feedbags that were added since the silo was last emptied to all the feed extractions that happened in this period. This is indirect recording of transformations; it is normally connected to a time span and it is quite common practice in the food industry. 3.2.3. Recording of weights or percentages Some implementations of traceability systems record weights or percentages relating to how much went into and how much came out of each transformation. If it is relevant to study yield quality or other production properties it is useful to record these quantities or percentages at each transformation (see the example in (Borit & Olsen 2012; Thakur S�rensen Bj�rnson For�s & Hurburgh 2011)). This will provide better industrial statistics it will enable the identification of dependencies and it will aid in production optimization. For food safety purposes however the main interest is in the presence or absence of connections in the traceability tree. If TRU 144 in Fig. 2 turns out to be contaminated TRUs 244 333 344 422 433 and 444 need to be recalled regardless of the amounts involved. 3.2.4. Recording of transformation metadata The transformation is the actual joining or splitting of TRUs whereas the transformation metadata are all the data relating to - or describing the transformation. A transformation may happen at an instant or it may be associated with a duration and the time or duration of the transformation is an example of transformation metadata often recorded in the traceability system (Olsen & Aschan 2010). Normally the transformation happens in a given location; data relating to the location is another example of transformation metadata; these may include environmental attributes like temperature pressure humidity or other environmental parameters. If these parameters are considered relevant (for example see (Zhang Liu Mu Moga & Zhang 2009)) the data in question also have to be recorded. 3.3. A mechanism for recording TRU attributes Once we have selected what type of identifier to use and we have found a way to associate the identifier to the TRU we have the ability to record attributes associated with the TRU in question and to link these attributes to the TRU identifier. For most FBOs the value of a traceability system lies in getting access to the many TRU attributes. Choosing an identifier associating an identifier with the TRU and documenting transformations are just means to an end; the main interest lies in the TRU attributes throughout the life cycle (Epelbaum & Martinez 2014) and especially for food safety purposes also lists of ancestor TRUs and progeny TRUs. The traceability system facilitates information flow in much the same way that a system of railroad tracks and carriages facilitates material flow; in this analogy the carriages contain recorded data rather than physical products. The mechanisms related to identifiers and transformations in a traceability system may be likened to the railroad track that connects everything together whereas the attributes recorded may be likened to the carriages that move on the tracks. The traceability mechanisms (the railroad track) is what ensures that data once recorded (the carriages) are connected and can be moved from place to place without loss. If the necessary mechanisms are in place (the railroad track) adding more attributes (carriages) is fairly trivial and from a system perspective there is no limit to the number of attributes that can be linked to a given TRU. Table 2 gives some examples from the ISO 12877 standard �Traceability of finfish products - Specification on the information to be recorded in farmed finfish distribution chains� (ISO 2011b) indicating attributes for fish coming from a fish farm. The TRU in question is typically fish in a cage or in a well-boat. In general assigning identifiers and recording transformations represent costs for the FBOs; the FBO is mostly interested in getting access to the attributes of all TRUs in the system and in knowing the ancestor TRUs and the progeny TRUs. Perhaps for this reason many publications and reports on traceability focus almost exclusively on the TRU attributes. However if we want to describe analyze or improve a traceability system we need to take all the components into consideration because without the other components indicated we would not have access to the TRU attributes that we are interested in. 4. Discussion Based on the analysis above the relationship between the components of a traceability system and their respective implementation options can be illustrated as in Fig. 3. As indicated above identification of TRUs is the key component that the other two build on. Without TRU identification transformations cannot be documented and TRU attributes cannot be recorded. The other two components are in principle independent; it is possible to record transformations but no attributes (Fig. 2 illustrates this) and it is possible to record attributes but no transformations. In practice however all three components are part of food industry traceability systems and the components need to be examined separately if we are studying the system. For each of the three components there are a number of options related to practical implementation as also indicated in Fig. 3. The implementation options represent questions to ask or decisions to make when deciding on how a particular component is implemented. When analyzing a traceability system Fig. 3 can be used as basis for a structured investigation and yields initial questions like: � How is the identifier associated with the TRU? � What is the identifier code type and structure? � In what context is the identifier unique; is there a one-to-one relationship between the identifier and the TRU? � How are transformations recorded? � How are weights or percentages recorded? � What transformation metadata are recorded? This initial analysis will highlight the identification and transformation components of the traceability system and will of course have to be followed by a thorough investigation of what attributes are recorded and how they are associated with the TRUs. The distinction between the different components is particularly important when discussing potential for improvement of the system. Elaborating on all possible traceability system weaknesses and possible improvements is beyond the scope of this article but a list of examples is included in Table 3 Table 4 and Table 5. For more information on identification of TRUs see (Bolic et al. 2010; Borit & Santos 2015). The advent of blockchain technology has obvious applications when it comes to transparent and persistent recording of transformations in a supply chain (Swan 2015) but it is beyond the scope of this article to discuss the potential of this technology and its limitations. For more information on transformations of TRUs and TRU types see (Mai Margeirsson Stefansson & Arason 2010). For more information on recording of TRU attributes see (Bosona & Gebresenbet 2013). A complicating factor is that everything in a traceability system must be considered a claim not a fact which means that we are also going to need mechanisms for verifying and validating the claims. Erroneous claims may occur e.g. because of production errors recording errors or deliberate fraud. See (Borit & Olsen 2012) for a discussion of this issue. P. Olsen M. Borit Trends in Food Science & Technology 77 (2018) 143�149 147 For some types of production in part of the supply chain the production is continuous there is no separation of TRUs and discrete TRU identifiers are not necessarily defined; dairy and grain production are examples of this. This type of production requires a slightly different type of traceability system and also some other components but these particular challenges have not been dealt with in this article. The references and the authors� experience are from the food sector but the components description is likely to be relevant and applicable to any product traceability system in a supply chain.

Implementation option How it may be improved Benefit from improvement Recording of transformations Explicit (linked to the TRU identifier) rather than implicit recording of transformations Explicit recordings are findable in the traceability system; implicit recordings are generally not persistent Smaller input batches or production batches so that the transformation involves a smaller number of TRUs Smaller potential recalls reduced risk Recording of weights or percentages Recording weights or percentages more accurately than in existing system (often relates to reducing the size of the input batches and production batches). Better industrial statistics; improved ability to study variations in yield and quality Recording transformation metadata Record (more) transformation metadata Ability to identify the transformation attributes Allow searching and filtering based on transformation metadata Ability to analyze transformations related to for example locations or time frames identify commonalities P.

Conclusion This main objective of this article is to name describe and make a clear distinction between the different components of a traceability system. In particular to distinguish between the mechanisms in a traceability system related to assigning identifiers and recording transformations as opposed to the TRU attributes that we want to get access to. This is a distinction not always made in previous articles reports and other documents relating to food traceability and this omission has in some instances led to unclear or incomplete analyses and conclusions. The distinction is particularly important when describing and comparing traceability systems and when recommending improvements to a given system. In both these cases the respective components need to be considered separately. Hopefully the distinctions made in this is article can serve as a useful starting point for future work on this topic.

2009 BORIT master thesis.pdf, Application of traceability in deterrence of illegal unreported and unregulated fishing: an analysis model of EU Regulation 1005/2008 and EU Regulation Proposal 2008/0216 (CNS)  By: Melania Bori?         Master Thesis in International Fisheries Management (30 credits) Institute for Aquatic Bio-Science Norwegian College of Fishery Science University of Troms� Norway  May 2009       I wish to thank:  Jorge SANTOS  for his excellent guidance thorough commitment and perfect supervision;  Emily ANDREWS-CHOUICHA (OECD) Marianne BRANDT (ICES) Duncan COPELAND (EJF) Peter FLEWWELLING (NFDS) Petter OLSEN (NOFIMA) Claire WELLING (ICES) Peter �REBECH (NFH UiT�) for their priceless help;  Silvia BUDU for her daily moral support;  Cornel BORI?  for his accurate proofreading precious support and understanding;  my MOTHER and my FATHER for everything.    ABSTRACT Illegal unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing is one important concern of fisheries managers and consumers alike all over the world. Recent IUU fishing deterrence strategies consider traceability the most promising indirect method to prevent its occurrence. Two of the three new pillars of the European Union Common Fisheries Policy (EU Regulation 1005/2008; EU Regulation Proposal 2008/0216 (CNS)) were explicitly developed to address this concern. These regulations attempt to introduce market monitoring measures that prevent IUU fish from entering legitimate trade channels in the Community. The leading purpose of this study was twofold: to analyse if the traceability related provisions of these two legal documents are relevant for IUU fishing deterrence and to test if they fulfil de lege lata the traceability requirements of the chain of custody. In order to achieve these aims a novel analytical tool that was suitable for the dual purposes had to be constructed. Model 1 was conceived to identify the overlapping of the necessary data for identifying IUU components (actors or products) with the traceability data recorded in the documentation imposed by the legal provisions at each critical traceability control point. Model 2 was designed to identify the fulfilment of the chain of custody requirements along the traceability control points. The present findings indicate that the traceability data retained according to the new legal EU norms have little relevance to be used effectively in deterrence of IUU operations. The product data are not constantly recorded at each critical traceability point and important information to help identify IUU fishing actors and products is not retained. Similarly the system put into place by both legal documents does not fulfil the requirements of a traceability scheme. Unique identification is not given to trade units thus hindering their traceability along the supply chain. Furthermore chain of custody requirements are scant allowing IUU fish to infiltrate the trade through the exposed links of the chain. Although the two analytical models utilized are preliminary they can be further developed to improve comprehensiveness and depth of scrutiny. Further both models are replicable and flexible as they can be used to analyse any legal text that puts into place a traceability system for the fish supply chain. Model 1 can be applied on single documents required by traceability systems at any critical traceability control point. Model 2 can be used to analyse a self standing traceability system implemented by any company. The models developed and the main findings of the study are of interest to both Community and third-country entities involved in a way or another in IUU fishing deterrence traceability in fish supply chains or legislation development. Future studies should focus on the design of a traceability system for fishery products that fits the purpose of IUU fishing deterrence under a de lege ferenda approach. Key-words: traceability; IUU fishing; chain of custody; critical control point; EU Regulation 1005/2008; EU Regulation Proposal 2008/0216 (CNS) de lege lata.

But as suggested by the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO) in 2001 the problem of illegal unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing in world fisheries is of serious and increasing concern. Some claim that by the beginning of the 21st Century almost 30% of the global fish catch could be counted as IUU in its diverse forms with a total catch value of nearly 1.500 million USD1. When confronted with IUU fishing weak national and regional fisheries management organizations that strive to achieve sound management goals may fail. Possible and logical consequences are the loss of both short and long-term social and economic opportunities and negative effects on food security and environmental protection. Un-confronted IUU fishing can lead to the collapse of a fishery or seriously impair efforts to rebuild stocks that have already been depleted. Existing international instruments addressing IUU fishing have not been effective due to a lack of political will priority capacity and resources to ratify or accede to and implement them2. By introducing fish traceability in the fisheries sector it is believed that it will be possible to check more closely what enters production and what leaves at the other end confronting thereby IUU fishing and improving the fisheries management at all levels.  The central notions of the present paper are IUU fishing and traceability as defined in the FAO International Plan of Action to Prevent Deter and Eliminate Illegal Unreported and Unregulated Fishing (2001) and respectively by the International Standard Organization (ISO) and the European Union (EU).  1.2 Problems to address and research questions The purpose of this study is to analyse if the traceability related provisions of two new EU legal instruments the EU Regulation 1005/2008 and EU Regulation Proposal 2008/0216 (CNS) are relevant and sufficient to prevent and deter IUU fishing and to fulfil the traceability requirements of the chain of custody.   1 Sumaila R. (2008). 2 FAO (2001) 1.   - 5 EU Regulation 1005/2008 establishing a Community system to prevent deter and eliminate illegal unreported and unregulated fishing. - Type: regulation. - Date of entry to force: 29.10.2008. - Date of application: 01.01.2010. - In what concerns the catch certificate it applies to all fish to be imported/exported to/from EU. - It is considered to be one of the most important legal steps in deterring the IUU operations both inside and outside the Community�s waters.  EU Regulation Proposal 2008/0216 (CNS) establishing a Community control system for ensuring compliance with the rules of the Common Fisheries Policy. - Type: proposal for a regulation. - Date of entry to force: unknown; it will be the day following its publication in the Official Journal of the EU. Most probably the text will be published in the second semester of 2009. - Date of application: 01.01.2010. If the norm is not published in the Official Journal of the EU by the end of 2009 its date of application will be postponed. - It refers to operations related to Community fishing vessels. - It enforces trade controls that should prevent products obtained through IUU operations from entering the fish supply chain of the EU.  The two legal documents created by the EU were selected for analysis as they constitute the new pillars of the Union�s Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). Their impact on the EU relations with third-countries and on the international trade with fishery products is yet not fully assessed. Nevertheless it is believed that these legal instruments put in place a comprehensive traceability system that will prevent IUU fish entering EU trade and thus help deterring IUU activities elsewhere as well.  Related issues such as eco-labelling and genetic traceability are also included in the present analysis for the sake of relatedness and complementarity.       - 6 The following research questions are addressed by this study:  - primary research questions:  How can a model be developed in order to analyse the connexion between IUU fishing deterrence and the fish traceability put in place by the EU Regulation 1005/2008 and EU Regulation Proposal 2008/0216 (CNS)?  What is the law (EU Regulation 1005/2008 and EU Regulation Proposal 2008/0216 (CNS)) in what concerns traceability issues?  What are the limitations of the fish traceability put in place by the EU Regulation 1005/2008 and EU Regulation Proposal 2008/0216 (CNS) to deter IUU fishing?  - secondary research questions:  What is the connexion between eco-labelling and IUU fish traceability?  What is the connexion between genetic traceability and IUU fishing deterrence?  1.3 Approach 1.3.1 Constraints Due to the breadth of the topic the paper will focus only on the theoretical legal and some operational aspects of the following issues: IUU fishing operations and the relevance of the market/trade management measures; IUU fishing in EU; traceability systems (including eco-labelling and genetic traceability); and the new EU legislation related to deterrence of IUU fishing by means of fish traceability (EU Regulation 1005/2008; EU Regulation Proposal 2008/0216 (CNS)).  It is not an ambition of the present work to address other national or regional policies legislation or operational initiatives other than those mentioned above. Neither given the limited scope of the research work may the paper compare the mentioned EU legislation to other Community traceability related norms nor assesses its relations to the relevant international law. Moreover the paper does not describe traceability standards in order to evaluate or improve them but only to assess if the new EU legal documents meet their requirements. Further this is a descriptive study and the provision of advice for improvement of the traceability system proposed through the provisions of EU Regulation 1005/2008 and EU Regulation Proposal 2008/0216 (CNS) would be out of bounds. Furthermore the paper does not assess the applicability the implementation or   - 7 enforcement of the regulations. Finally the paper is not a de lege ferenda type of study as it does not provide advice about how the traceability regulations comprised in the two norms should be. What this paper is about is presenting the law as it is thus being a de lege lata type of study.  1.3.2 Research strategy theory hypothesis objective The research strategy used is abductive reasoning (�application of traceability entails reduction of IUU fishing�) in the context of an interdisciplinary approach that combines data from biology juridical sciences forensics and economics. At the same time this paper is constructed on the descriptive theory paradigm therefore it describes and interprets how things are but not how they should be starting from the presumption that fish traceability will in the future be the indirect tool of excellence to eliminate IUU fish from the EU trade.  1.3.3 Methodology In order to achieve the proposed goal a mixture of qualitative and quantitative methods was used: doctrinal (theoretical) and non-doctrinal (descriptive) legal research; secondary data analysis; qualitative data analysis; case study; informal interviews. In order to achieve the aim of the paper two models were designed. Model 1 was conceived to identify the overlapping of the necessary data for identifying IUU components (actors or products) with the traceability data recorded in the documentation imposed by the legal provisions at each critical traceability control point. Model 2 was designed to identify the fulfilment of the requirements of the chain of custody along the traceability control points. Identifiers of IUU fishing activities were constructed necessary traceability parameters were included critical traceability control points were identified along the fishery products chain of custody and chain of custody standards were designated. All these entries were plotted against the new legal requirements and the qualitative rating displayed in case-ordered predictor-outcome N-way matrices. The specific methodology followed in order to construct the analytical models is presented in Chapter 4.  1.4 Structure of the paper Chapter 2 defines IUU fishing illustrates the actual extension of the problem and describes its drivers and market/trade counter-measures all with the purpose of framing the conditions for proper application of traceability schemes.   - 8  Chapter 3 defines traceability circumscribes its drivers its legal framework standards certification schemes and implications for eco-labelling. The conventional traceability system is described and some analytical methods are exemplified in order to first understand this general concept before finding its application in fisheries management.  Following the presentation of general issues related to IUU operations and traceability an attempt to intersect the two and define their common grounds within the framework of EU Regulation 1005/2008 and EU Regulation Proposal 2008/0216 (CNS) is made in Chapter 4. The analysis and discussion sections identify how the new legal provisions deal with traceability in connexion with IUU fishing deterrence and if they fit the purpose they were designed for. A comprehensive model that summarizes the findings displayed in matrices is designed. Finally the findings of the two Models the connexions between eco-labelling and IUU fish traceability and genetic traceability and IUU fishing deterrence are addressed in Chapter 5.                      - 9  2. ILLEGAL UNREPORTED AND UNREGULATED FISHING  2.1 Background 2.1.1 Definitions Commonly referred to as �pirate fishing� the illegal unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing comprises a broad range of activities3 and a more specific characterization of the term is called upon. Domestically fishing without a licence out of season or prohibited species using banned types of fishing gear catching more fish than is allowed and not reporting or misreporting catch weights are all examples of deceitful behaviour and IUU activities. Internationally fishing contrary to the fisheries conservation and management measures of a regional fisheries management organization (RFMO) or fishing in a State�s jurisdictional waters without authorization are more examples of IUU fishing.  The only internationally agreed definition of IUU fishing is found in the International Plan of Action to Prevent Deter and Eliminate Illegal Unreported and Unregulated Fishing (IPOA-IUU) a voluntary binding instrument adopted by the Food and Agricultural Organisation of the United Nations (FAO) in 2001. This followed from the framework set by the FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries (1995). Later in 2008 the European Union (EU) agreed upon a similar definition of IUU fishing which was included in the Council Regulation 1005/20084 establishing a Community system to prevent deter and eliminate IUU fishing.  According to the provisions of Article 3 IPOA-IUU5 the following fishing activities are considered as illegal: fishing �conducted by national or foreign vessels in waters under the jurisdiction of a State without the permission of that State or in contravention of its laws and regulations; fishing conducted by vessels flying the flag of States that are parties to a relevant regional fisheries management organization but operate in contravention of the conservation and management measures adopted by that organization and by which the States are bound or relevant provisions of the applicable international law; or in violation  3 EJF (2005) page 2. 4 Council Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008 of 29.10.2008 establishing a Community system to prevent deter and eliminate illegal unreported and unregulated fishing amending Regulations (EEC) No 2847/93 (EC) No 1936/2001 and (EC) No 601/2004 and repealing Regulations (EC) No 1093/94 and (EC) No 1447/1999 published in on 29.10.2008 in the Official Journal of the European Union L 286/1. 5 FAO (2001) 1.   - 10 of national laws or international obligations including those undertaken by co-operating States to a relevant regional fisheries management organization.�  Fishing activities �which have not been reported or have been misreported to the relevant national authority in contravention of national laws and regulations; or undertaken in the area of competence of a relevant regional fisheries management organization which have not been reported or have been misreported in contravention of the reporting procedures of that organization� are defined as unreported.  According to the same provisions fishing activities �in the area of application of a relevant regional fisheries management organization that are conducted by vessels without nationality or by those flying the flag of a State not party to that organization or by a fishing entity in a manner that is not consistent with or contravenes the conservation and management measures of that organization� are considered unregulated. Likewise are considered fishing activities �in areas or for fish stocks in relation to which there are no applicable conservation or management measures and where such fishing activities are conducted in a manner inconsistent with State responsibilities for the conservation of living marine resources under international law�.  Taking a step forward the EU Regulation 1005/2008 widens in Article 3(1) the concept of fishing vessel engaged in IUU fishing by presuming that a fishing vessel is carrying out this kind of activities if it is proved that: - it has falsified or concealed its markings identity or registration; - concealed tampered with or disposed of evidence relating to an investigation; - obstructed the work of inspectors checking compliance with applicable conservation and management measures; - transhipped or landed undersized fish; - transhipped from supported ore re-supplied other fishing vessels identified as having engaged in IUU fishing.      - 11 Figure 1 is an illustration of types of IUU fishing based on the above definitions. Within an EEZ there may be unlicensed fishing (poaching) under- or non-reported or unauthorised fishing by area season gear quota or species. Outside EEZs there may be non-compliance with an RFMO or there may be unregulated fishing outside the area of an RFMO. Many RFMOs also cover adjoining EEZ waters but the primary jurisdiction in these cases remains that of the coastal state so the RFMO was drawn as bounding on EEZ waters.6   Figure 17: Illustration of types of IUU fishing activities.   Although the seriousness of infraction may vary from fishery to fishery the extent of IUU fishing is not insignificant: it has been estimated that almost 25% of the fish landed in 2004 was caught in a manner that can be defined as IUU fishing8 (Figure 2).   Figure 29: Estimated global fish landings 1950-2004 including estimates of different types of IUU fishing.   6 MRAG (2005) page 11. 7 MRAG (2005) page 11. 8 MRAG & University of British Columbia (2008) page 17. 9 Sumaila R. (2008) page 5.   - 12 2.1.2 State of art in IUU fishing10 In its broadest sense IUU fishing is a worldwide issue affecting both domestic waters and high seas all types of fishing vessels regardless of their size or type of gear and a multitude of species with global (e.g. tuna and tuna-like species) or local (e.g. Patagonian toothfish) impact (Figure 3). As underlined by FAO already in 200111 IUU fishing undermines efforts to conserve and manage fish stocks in many regulated fisheries. When confronted with this problem national and regional fisheries management organizations can fail to achieve management goals the situation ultimately leading to the collapse of a fishery or seriously impairing efforts to rebuild depleted stocks. In addition IUU fishing activities may have negative impacts on the marine ecosystem through their direct or indirect effects on the populations of seabirds marine mammals sea turtles and biodiversity as a whole (discards by-catch).  Figure 312: Global incidence of illegal fishing (based on data from 1980-2003).  Moreover IUU fishing may alter competition and put at risk the economic survival of those who fish in accordance with the law and in compliance with relevant conservation and management measures. Therefore IUU fishing may bear important social costs affecting the food-security and livelihoods of fishing-dependent countries and communities. Because many of the crewmembers on IUU fishing vessels are themselves from poor and underdeveloped regions often working in inadequate social and safety  10 Based on OECD (2004) pages 11-12. 11 FAO (2001) 1. 12 Sumaila R. (2008) page 8.   - 13 conditions the socio-economic problem is two-sided and complex. For an overview of the most important indicators and shocks borne of IUU fishing activities see Appendix 1.  One conclusion reached by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Workshop on IUU fishing activities (2004) is that IUU fishing is a dynamic and multi-faceted problem and that no single strategy is sufficient to eliminate or reduce it. Therefore a concerted and multi-divided approach is required nationally regionally and internationally and by type of fishery. In order to find viable solutions to the IUU fishing problem all actors should be involved in the process: governments communities NGOs and the private sector.  The FAO IPOA-IUU contains tools to tackle the IUU fishing issue but the question is to find better ways to implement these tools and to make all countries (developed or developing) responsible in complying with their duties as flag states port states coastal states states of vessel owners and trading nations.  2.1.3 The extent of IUU fishing in EU Marine fishing and associated processing and commerce are important industries for a number of coastal communities in the EU. IUU fishing in various forms is a significant threat to achieving biologically sustainable fisheries and a serious management problem for a large number of the fisheries on which these industries and coastal communities depend. As shown in Figure 4 the IUU fishing activities bear a high social economical and environmental cost as the percentage of fish caught in activities defined as IUU fishing is considerably high (Figure 5).  The volume of illegal fisheries products imported each year into the EU has been assessed to amount approximately 500.000 tons for a value of 11 billion euro13 regardless if the place of capture was inside or outside the Community�s waters.   13 http://www.eubusiness.com/Fisheries/iuu-fishing-eu/ (accessed: 07.05.2009).   - 14  Figure 414: Summary of estimated IUU fishing costs of all EU Member States for the IUU activities carried in EU�s waters.                 Figure 515: The Large Marine Ecosystems adjacent to the coastlines of EU Member States and the amount of IUU fishing activities done by EU and non-EU vessels inside EU�s EEZs (IUU rates are expressed as a percentage of a fishery�s total catch).  14 EFTEC (2008) page 69. The study reviews evidence on the rates of IUU fishing in European waters and on the costs associated with IUU fishing activities. The study develops a simulation model for fisheries at the Large Marine Ecosystem (LME) scale using a surplus production model applied at the level of key commercial groups (cod-likes perch-likes herring-likes tuna and billfishes) in each LME representing 46% of the value of European fishing. 15 EFTEC (2008) page 9.   - 15 2.2 Drivers of IUU fishing activities Attempts have been made to identify and address the drivers of IUU fishing with particular regard to its illegal and unreported (IU) components. Starting from the precept that �expected profits from IUU fishing = expected benefits from IUU - expected costs of IUU� in 2005 the OECD�s Committee for Fisheries identified groups of important economic and social drivers of IUU fishing activities (Appendix 2). Among these the market value of the IUU fish can be considered the decisive one as without it most of the others would be annihilated.  Responses in the global survey demonstrate the significant economic gains available through IUU fishing. Demand for fish as a healthy wholesome food is increasing in all parts of the world and in a paradoxal way the more legal fishing is constrained by catch and effort limits � as the overall state of global fish stocks requires in many cases � the greater the motivation for and gains from IUU fishing.16  Since there are strong economic drivers for IUU fishing and it occurs in situations of poor fisheries management and control one might expect that the level of illegal fishing should be related mostly to fish price governance and indicators of the control problem such as the area of a country's EEZ and the number of patrol vessels at its disposal. In fact in a study conducted in 200817 with respect to illegal and unreported fishing no significant relationship was found between these activities and the price of fish or the size of the EEZ or of the fishery. Nevertheless a significant relationship between the IU fishing and the World Bank governance indicators could be established for all fisheries across Africa Asia and Europe (Figure 6).  The result does not imply that developing countries with poor governance records are necessarily to blame for IU fishing but that they are more vulnerable to this kind of activities conducted by both their own fishermen and vessels from distant water fishing nations (e.g. fishing vessels from China EU or Russia conducting IU activities in African states waters). This represents a failure of control on behalf of the flag state as well as the coastal state.  16 Bray K (2000) page 1. 17 Agnew DJ; Pearce J.; Pramod G.; Peatman T; Watson R. et al. (2009).   - 16 Furthermore many vessels engaged in both illegal and unreported activities on one hand and unregulated on the other are registered under �flags of convenience� states. While these states are in most cases developing countries the vessels themselves are usually owned and operated by developed countries companies.  Figure 618: Relationship between the amount of illegal and un-reported fishing (expressed as a proportion of the reported catch that is additionally taken as illegal and unreported catch) and an average of four World Bank indices of governance (Government Effectiveness Regulatory Quality Rule of Law and Control of Corruption) measured in 2003.  2.3 Management measures in place against IUU fishing Even though the high seas are open to all states the freedom to fish is limited by the basic conditions set out in the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) (1982). In addition to UNCLOS the current international instruments related to high seas fisheries are the FAO Compliance Agreement (1993) the UN Fish Stock Agreement (1995) the FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries (1995) and the FAO IPOA - IUU (2001). While the first two are legally binding international instruments containing requirements  18 Agnew DJ; Pearce J.; Pramod G.; Peatman T; Watson R. et al. (2009).   - 17 relating to flag State responsibilities compliance and enforcement the last two are voluntary and management-oriented instruments.  Analysing the structure of an IUU operation (Figure 7) one can break down this kind of process into three segments19 and each of them can be targeted by measures specially designed for it: - first fishing vessel activity segment from vessel registration to landing of fish at a port. This is the �at sea� segment which corresponds largely to what is understood by �IUU fishing�. - second the logistical aspect of an IUU operation addresses the organisation of supplies and services (re-fuelling transhipment change of crew etc.). - third the catch/product in trade and market segment. This is where income-flows occur and net incomes are generated and this is the main purpose and driving force for IUU operations.  Figure 720. The chain of IUU fishing operations.  A management measure configured to address an IUU operation effectively would need to deal with all three segments of the phenomenon and would have to exploit potentials to cut across these segments. Appendix 3 provides an overview of the most important tools against IUU operations based on FAO Code of Conduct and FAO IPOA-IUU.  19 OECD (2004) page 22. 20 OECD (2004) page 21.   - 18 Among these tools the market and trade related measures have a clear potential to address all the three aspects of the IUU operation. For example by improvement of the transparency of the markets in order to allow the traceability of fish and fish products IUU fish can be stopped form entering the trade (segment 3). At the same time important information about IUU actors (vessel owners beneficial ownership importers buyers consumers bankers insurers transhippers equipment suppliers; IUU ports IUU vessels) can be retrieved in order to eliminate them from fishing operations (segments 1 and 2). The traceability of fish and fish products can be enhanced by introducing mandatory controls of importation and exportation of goods (catch certification and trade documentation requirements) and import and export restrictions and prohibitions whose violation could be tracked. Eco-labelling could also be one cross-cut measure as the certification of a fishery guarantees the absence of IUU activities at sea (segments 1 and 2) and the product chain of custody certification ensures that only non-IUU fishing products enter the trade (segment 3).  2.4 Compliance with FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries requirements with respect to IU fishing21 The FAO Code of Conduct together with the FAO IPOA-IUU is considered one of the most important instrument containing tools to address IUU fishing. In 2005 WWF and the University of British Columbia Fisheries Centre initiated a project to assess the Code�s implementation applying a consistent assessment protocol to data for 2003-2005 to 53 countries representing over 95% of the world�s wild fisheries catch.  The conclusion of the report is that none of the 53 countries achieves what was considered a �good� score of 70% or more (Figure 7). Only six countries (11%) have overall compliance scores whose confidence limits overlap 60% (Norway USA Canada Australia Iceland Namibia). This means that ten years after the Code of Conduct was agreed there was a lot of space for improvement of governance and compliance even among those countries at the top end of the rankings. At the lower end the alarming finding is that 28 countries (53%) had �fail grades� of less than 40% (Peru Poland India Ghana Taiwan Latvia Philippines Brazil Argentina Morocco Pakistan Russia Senegal Ecuador Indonesia Iran Thailand Ukraine Sri Lanka Viet Nam Turkey  21 Based on Pitcher T. J.; Kalikoski D.; Pramod G. and Short K. (2008).   - 19 Bangladesh Egypt Yemen Nigeria Angola Myanmar North Korea). In the middle range disappointing scores were obtained by most developed European nations with the undoubted resources and know-how to implement the Code. This reinforces the impression of the low political priority given to improving fisheries management internationally. Some developing countries score as fairly in the implementation of the Code as a developed European country indicating that elements of good fishery management can be achieved even with limited resources. A negative relationship with a marine biodiversity index suggests that management is weakest in the most species rich jurisdictions. Although it is expected that the biodiversity index would be confounded with both economic and governance indicators (�poor countries are richer in biodiversity�) this fact suggests that implementation of good practices is easier where fisheries target intensively a lower number of species.  Figure 822. �Codeometer� showing estimated overall compliance of the top 53 marine fishing countries FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries. Colours indicate good scores (70% and over) fail scores (40% and below) and intermediate values.  In what concerns the compliance with the Code in terms of measures to be taken for deterring IUU fishing the same report estimates that only 26% of the countries deal reasonably with illegal fishing activities while most countries (60%) address the problem unsatisfactorily (Figure 9). It is worth to note that among the countries rated to effectively tackle illegal fishing there are only three EU states (out of 11 included in the study) and two EEA states.  22 Pitcher T. J.; Kalikoski D.; Pramod G. and Short K. (2008) page 8.   - 20  Figure 923. Bar chart showing compliance with the Code of Conduct in controlling illegal fishing for the 53 top fishing countries. Broken lines: green denotes �good� compliance rating; red denotes �fail� rating. Note that even though the chart refers to illegal fishing the study analyses it in terms of IUU fishing. There is sometimes confusion in the terminology and issues are often confounded but this should not detract from the generality of the results of the study cited.  The results obtained by this study with respect to EU member states can be correlated with the ones found by another 2008 study24 that focused only on IUU fishing activities carried out inside Community�s waters. As shown in Figure 10 a high proportion of illegal activities25 take part in EU Member States. This goes together with a relatively poor score by EU Member States for their ability to control illegal fishing (Figure 11) substantially worse than the scores for Iceland and Norway (EEA countries) and similar or little better than for Morocco (developing country) and Turkey (intermediate country).   23 Pitcher T. J.; Kalikoski D.; Pramod G. and Short K. (2008) page 13. 24 EFTEC (2008). The study refers in this particular case of relating EU Member States fishing activities with IUU fishing to the Pitcher T Kalikoski D and Pramod G (2008) �Evaluations of Compliance with the FAO (UN) Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries� study available at www.fisheries.ubc.ca/publications/reports/report14_2.php. This later one used 44 questions for each country in which scoring was based on the assessment of 2332 separate analyses including: national legislation international treaties country synopses from FAO country reports to FAO and by NGOs websites of national fisheries agencies NGO websites literature and information from fisheries experts. 25 One should bear in mind that even though the figures relate only to illegal fishing the study refers to them as connected to IUU fishing. As in the previous case there is sometimes confusion in the terminology and issues are often confounded but this should not detract from the generality of the results of the study cited.   - 21 When analysing the figures one should not pay attention to the exact scoring (e.g. score 10 for Spain in Figure 10 would imply that 100% of the Spanish fishing fleet is undertaking illegal activities inside the Community�s waters) but to its overall significance (e.g. in Figure 10 the important issue is that too many of EU vessels are engaged in illegal operations inside the Community�s waters).  Figure 1026. Country scores on �Are vessels fishing illegally in the fisheries?� Bars indicate ranges of scores in the study.  Member States� scores for the effectiveness of observer schemes catch inspections and vessel monitoring are 5.8 4.5 and 4.8 respectively out of 10 (Figure 12) reflecting a poor standard of enforcement within the EU as compared to those enforced by the neighbouring EEA fishing countries in their home waters. As underlined in the report the EU low to moderate standards of enforcement and follow-up influence the risk of detection of IUU activity and the expected penalties which in turn lower the expected costs of engaging in IUU fishing.        26 EFTEC (2008) page 18.   - 22  Figure 1127: Countries scores on �How effective is control of access to stop illegal fishing?�  Figure 1228. Average scores for effectiveness of observer schemes catch inspections and vessel monitoring.  All these results should be read critically as the severity of the infractions is not clearly defined in such an aggregated presentation of findings. However in a cross-sectional perspective (across countries) the contrasting trend between illegal fishing (and by extension of other forms of IUU) and the level of control and surveillance is clear.   27 EFTEC (2008) page 18. 28 EFTEC (2008) page 15.   - 23 In summary at the core of the IUU fishing issue lays a number of drivers that Member States and the Community must seriously address. In the EU context this encompasses such known problems as over-capacity tradition and lack of alternatives to fishing by some and a high demand for fish products by a generally wealthy population. The later also creates a drive to the import of IUU international fish commodities along food supply chains. It is also becoming increasingly evident that adequate control and surveillance including aspects related to traceability have a complementary role to play in the deterrence and prevention of irresponsible fishing.                               - 24  3. TRACEABILITY  3.1 Definitions of traceability categories and drivers 3.1.1 Definitions Even though the concept of traceability is relatively new its acception changed in time. Therefore different institutions with authority in this domain are still trying to thoroughly circumscribe it as specialists in traceability are not really in full agreement with what traceability is and what is not.29  a. International Organization of Standardization (ISO) One of the first definitions of traceability a very practical one and often used is found in the international standard ISO 8402:1994 Quality management and quality assurance � Vocabulary: traceability is �the ability to trace the history application or location of an entity by means of recorded identifications� (my italics). In 2000 the International Organisation for Standardization withdrew this standard replacing it with ISO 9000:2000 Quality management systems - Guidelines for performance improvements where traceability is defined in a less specific way as being �the ability to trace the history application or location of that which is under consideration� (my italics). Both standards include an additional clause which states that when relating to products traceability specifically entails �the origin of materials and parts the processing history and the distribution and location of the product after delivery�. The difference between the two definitions is that in the newer one �recorded identifications� are no longer mentioned. According to ISO 8402 objective methods or instruments that give immediate values for entity properties (for instance devices that measure fat water content alcohol content colour salinity etc. in food items) did not provide traceability. In contrast according to the new definition of ISO 9000 they offer traceability. Therefore sometimes the objective methods and instruments are considered to provide traceability control mechanisms rather than traceability as such. For example they are used to verify the claims made in the recorded identifications.30   29 Discussions during Workshop �Harmonizing methods for food traceability process mapping and cost/benefit calculations related to implementation of electronic traceability systems� NOFIMA Troms� Norway 25-26.02.2009. 30 http://www.tracefood.org/index.php/ (accessed: 18.04.2008).   - 25 b. European Union Resembling more with the newer ISO standard the European Community Regulation 178/2002 General principles and requirements of food law defines traceability in Article 3(15) as �the ability to trace and follow a food feed food-producing animal or substance intended to be or expected to be incorporated into a food or feed through all stages of production processing and distribution�.31  c. FAO/WHO Codex Alimentarius Citing the Procedural Manual developed by the Codex Alimentarius Commission the CAC/GL 60-2006 standard developed by FAO/WHO defines traceability/product tracing as �the ability to follow the movement of a food through specified stage(s) of production processing and distribution�32 thus being closer to the newer ISO standard.  3.1.2 Categories Traceability can be distinguished into two interrelated categories: internal traceability and external or chain traceability33 graphically depicted in Figure 13.  Figure 13.34 Traceability along the food supply chain. Filled arrows show the product flow; open arrows show the information flow.   31 OJ L31/1/ 2002 page 8. 32 CAC/GL 60-2006 page 1 at http://www.codexalimentarius.net/web/standard_list.do?lang=en (accessed: 18.04.2009) and FAO/WHO (2008) page 20. 33 http://www.tracefood.org/index.php/ (accessed: 18.04.2008). 34 Randrup M. et al. (2008) page 1065.   - 26 Internal traceability refers to the ability to keep track of what happens to a product its ingredients and packaging within a company or production facility. For example when a company receives a box of mackerel and uses the fish to produce flavoured smoked mackerel it has to keep records from whom the fish was received if the fish was divided in batches or mixed with other received raw material what smoking process was used (cold or warm smoking) what ingredients were used and where did they come from where the finished product packing came from where the finished product goes. External traceability refers to the ability to keep track of what happens to a product its ingredients and packaging in the entire or part of a supply chain35. For example if a customer in a supermarket wants to know if the purchased fish was caught by trawl or long line it should be possible to find this information with an external traceability system.  Using a metaphor36 the concept of traceability can be compared with a train track that crosses all the points of the supply chain (harvesting - primary processor - secondary processor - retailer) while the train carriages are the information retained at each of these points by means of internal traceability. Traceability downstream (back) can be called �tracing� and upstream (forward) �tracking�37.  In practice the term traceability can be used in distinct contexts each with a different implied sense38: 1. Product; it may relate materials their origin processing history and their distribution and location after delivery. 2. Data; it relates calculations and data generated throughout the quality loop sometimes back to the requirements for quality; it relates to transformation information (identification+transformation relations) and product information (origin+processing history+location).39 3. IT and programming; it relates design and implementation back to the requirements for a system.   35 The supply chain can be defined as �the entire chain the product travels through from raw materials to consumption� (http://www.bordbiavantage.ie/bordbia/preview.asp?pid=3&mid=11&cid=37&id=37; accessed: 18.04.2009). 36 Olsen P.

These drivers circumscribe the requirements for the identification and information systems.41 Figure 15 shows these drivers and their inter-relations.     Figure 15.42 Traceability drivers in the food sector.         Risk avoidance drivers (the left side of the diagrams) and economic development drivers (the right side of the diagrams) are considered old traditional ones while the documentation of sustainability driver is a new one which emerged in the last few years from the growing global concern about natural resources and environment.  3.2 Legislation standardisation certification and eco-labelling 3.2.1 Legislation At this moment at Community level the EU Regulation 178/2002 General principles and requirements of food law is the most relevant piece of legislation in the area of food traceability. In the area of fish fish and fishery products traceability the EU Regulation 1005/2008 and the EU Regulation Proposal CNS/2008/0216 are the most important legal documents.  41 Bollen A.F.; Riden C.P. and Opara L.U. (2006) page 94. 42 Olsen P. (2009) 1 page 8.   - 29 a. EU Regulation 178/200243 From 2005 the European Commission set into force a new food law (Common food law) and established the European Food Safety Authority. The general principles and requirements of this law are specified in EU Regulation 178/2002. As an instrument to deal with food crises and a rapid increasingly global trade this regulation has a strong focus on food safety reduction of food induced health risks protection of consumers and building up confidence in food and food production. The ability to carry out recalls of contaminated products is considered as an important functionality in a future food safety regime. This requirement is partly built into Regulation 178/2002 by the so called "one-up/forward onedown/backward approach" where all producers have to document from whom they have received food stuffs and to whom they have sent their products.44  In connexion with the same problematic addressed by this Regulation EU developed other legal documents that deal in a more or less specific way with traceability of food in general or of fish and fish products in particular. For an overview of the most relevant of them see Appendix 4.  b. EU Regulation 1005/2008 and EU Regulation Proposal 2008/0216 (CNS)45 Both EU Regulation 1005/2008 and EU Regulation Proposal 2008/0216 (CNS) try to implement within the Community Member States the traceability requirement for the fish and fishery products by introducing different recorded documents along the custody chain. It is important to specify that these two legal norms are of regulation type which requires direct implementation in the Member States.  When deciding if the new legislation should take the form of the Code of Conduct or a regulatory instrument in the form of a new binding regulation the European Commission adopted the later option.46 This choice was taken in order to consolidate and simplify the existing legislation develop a new harmonised approach to inspection and control (covering all aspects from �net to plate�) to develop a common culture of compliance and to ensure the effective application of Common Fisheries Policy rules.  43 EU Official Journal L31/1 (2002); 44 http://www.tracefood.org/index.php/Traceability:Legislation (accessed: 19.04.2009). 45 Together with EU Regulation Proposal CNS/2007/0114 concerning authorisations for fishing activities of Community fishing vessels outside Community waters and the access of third country vessels to Community waters they form the new pillars of the EU Common Fisheries Policy. 46 European Commission (2008).   - 30 Therefore EU Member States have to transpose into their national legislation both new documents as such one of the outcomes having to be a global and integrated control system to deter IUU fishing.  3.2.2 Standardisation It is generally accepted that there are three types of standards47: - First-party standards � developed by a company for application within the company. They are used by the company but they are open to important criticism concerning conflict of interest. - Second-party standards � developed by an industry organisation for application to the entire industry sector. In their case the common criticisms are conflict of interest and playing to lowest common denominator.48 - Third-party standards � developed by organisations independent of the industry to which the standards apply. They are often seen as the preferred choice in supporting the dissemination of environmental information to consumers as they have the appearance of independence and objectivity. Nevertheless the true objectivity of these standards is dependent on the range of input provided during the standard development process. Therefore including a wide range of stakeholders could assure the objectiveness and independence of the standard. All standards presented hereunder are third-party type.  ISO introduced in the last five years three new standards49 that define the requirements for a traceability system within a food safety management system and the data that needs to be retained (ISO 22000:2005 Food safety management systems � requirements; ISO 22519 traceability system in the agriculture food chain general principles for design and development; ISO 22005:2007 Traceability in the feed and food chain - General principles and basic requirements for system design and implementation).50  47 Philips B.; Ward T.; Chaffee C. (2003) pages 5-6; 48 Industry associations are usually in the position of having to protect all members equally so creating standards that allow for significant differentiation among members is often against the charter of the association unless the express wishes of its paying members. 49 An ISO standard is a documented agreement containing technical specifications or other precise criteria to be used consistently as rules guidelines or definitions of characteristics to ensure that materials products processes and services are fit for their purpose.

(2007) page 13; and http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail?csnumber=36297 (accessed: 19.04.2009).   - 31 In the fish and fish products traceability area ISO is developing now a new technical standard ISO TC234 Traceability of fish products � Specification on the information to be recorded in captured fish distribution chains which is for the moment still in the draft stage.  Besides ISO both the international organisation Codex Alimentarius and the European Committee for Standardization (CEN) have also dealt with questions on traceability during the last years establishing the following standards: - Alimentarius CAC/GL 60-2006 Principles for Traceability/Product Tracing as a Tool within a Food Inspection and Certification System; - CEN/CWA 14659:2003 - Traceability of fishery products: Specification of the information to be recorded in farmed fish distribution chains; - CEN/CWA 14660:2003 - Traceability of fishery products: Specification on the information to be recorded in captured fish distribution chains (it constitutes the starting point for ISO TC234); - CEN/SS C01-Food Products prEN ISO 22005 Traceability in the feed and food chain: General principles and basic requirements for system design and implementation (ISO/FDIS 22005:2007).51  There are many other traceability standards developed by different institutions but it is important to state that except CEN/CWA 14660:2003 and ISO TC234 standards all the other standards that deal with information needed in captured fish distribution chains do not standardize on parameter level.52 Therefore recorded data is not measurable stopping only at a surface level of quantifiable recording (e.g. parameter level: register transport vehicle number; non-parameter level: register only type of transport-truck vessel plane train).  3.2.3 Certification Certification is the procedure by which a certification body gives written or equivalent assurance that a product process or service conforms to certain standards.53   51 Aarnisalo K.; Heiskanen S.; Jaakkola K.; Landor E. and Raaska L. (2007) page 13. 52 Olsen P. (2009) 2 page 16. 53 FAO (2009) page 15.   - 32 As in the case of standards there are three types of certification: - First-party certification � by which a single company or stakeholder group develops its own standards analyzes its own performance and reports on its compliance. - Second-party certification � where an industry or trade association or NGO develops standards analyzes the performance of involved parties and reports on compliance. - Third party certification � where an accredited external independent certification body which is not involved in standards setting or has any other conflict of interest analyzes the performance of involved parties and reports on compliance.  3.2.4 Eco-labelling54 Eco-labelling schemes which are a marked based private sector mechanism to manage the sustainable use of natural resources can be categorized as follows55: - First party labelling schemes: established by individual companies based on their own product standards with �self declared� compliance. - Second party labelling schemes: established by industry associations for their member�s products; compliance is verified through internal audit procedures or by employing external companies as auditors (e.g. Bureau Veritas). - Third party labelling schemes: developed by a body independent of procedures distributors and sellers of the labelled products. The label is licensed to a producer. The �chain of custody� is tracked to ensure that the labelled product it is in fact derived form the certified one. Audit is conducted by independent third-party certifier.  The eco-labelling certification process has two distinct stages:  1. fishery certification (three phases: pre-pre assessment pre-assessment and full assessment);   54 One should not mistake eco-labelling for a certification scheme as eco-labelling schemes use certification ones as processes within their own procedure. 55 FAO (2001) 2 page 11.   - 33 2. chain of custody certification. This refers to the set of measures which makes sure that a certified product originates from a certified production chain and is not mixed with noncertified products. Chain of custody verification measures track/trace the product throughout the production processing distribution and marketing chain with corresponding documentation56 as showed in Figure 16.  Figure 16.57 Summary of chain of custody from a certified fishery throughout to consumer.  The client who is under assessment can decide to stop the process after the first stage in this case only the fishery being awarded the eco-label certification (e.g. after passing this step under MSC standards the USA Alaska salmon fishery claims that is MSC certified) or it can decide to complete the second stage in which case the products derived from the fishery being allowed to carry the eco-label. During the certification process the burden of proof is reversed which means that the client has to demonstrate the certification body that it meets the certification scheme standards.      56 FAO (2009) page 15. 57 Modified from Philips B.; Ward T.; Chaffee C. (2003) page 88.   - 34 As shown in Appendix 5 there are quite a number of standards certification schemes and labels in fisheries and aquaculture. This situation can be confusing for all parties and there is an obvious need for comparison of practices - the benchmarking58 issue. While in aquaculture a benchmarking study was undertaken by WWF in 200759 in capture fisheries this comparability study is lacking. There are strong indications that this kind of study is more than needed in the industry as voiced by the stakeholders during the Round Table on eco-labelling and certification in fisheries sector held in The Hague in April 2009.  3.3 Traceability systems 3.3.1 Types of systems Not all traceability systems are equivalent and/or interchangeable nor can they necessarily be consolidated. Different purposes and systems also trigger different expectations in producers and consumers that do not always correspond to the traceability system in use (regulatory contractual or voluntary). This partially explains the current uncertainty related to traceability requirements and to the possible implications of traceability regulations. Table 1A presents the most fish and fish products common traceability systems as identified by FAO/Globefish in 2006.60  Table 1A. Traceability systems: purpose objective attributes standards and examples.

Purpose Objective Attributes Standard Example Mandatory EU Regulation Proposal CNS/2008/0216 Documentation of sustainability Natural resource sustainability Specified in environment protection regulations Voluntary FAO IPOA-IUU  3.3.2 Components Traceability systems are constructions which enable traceability. There are several essential elements of traceability constituting an integrated food supply chain traceability system.61 These elements are: 1. Product traceability - defines the physical location of a product at any stage in the supply chain. 2. Process traceability - ascertains the type of activities that have affected the product during the growing and post harvest operations (what where and when).  61 Opara L.U. (2003) pages 102-103.   - 36 3. Genetic traceability - determines the genetic composition of the product and includes information on the type and origin (source supplier). 4. Inputs traceability - determines type and origin (source supplier) of inputs e.g. fertilizers additives used for preservation or transformation of the raw materials into processed products. 5. Disease and pest traceability - traces the epidemiology of microbiological hazards and pests which may contaminate food products. 6. Measurement traceability - relates individual measurement results through calibrations to reference standards and assures the quality of measurements by observing various factors which may have impact on results (such as environmental factors operator etc.).  3.3.3 Characteristics A good identification system for a product must fulfil the legal requirements must be unique legible resistant to damage easy to capture for records tamper-proof (resistant to interference) able to avoid fraud and incapable of reuse.62 Effective traceability is the result of structured data acquisition and clarity of reporting. The acquired data should be easily accessible and scrutinable quickly searchable and descriptions of production flows should be understandable.  Products and activities are core entities of a traceability system and they are defined by a set of essential descriptors that must be included in order to secure the system (Figure 17).    Figure 17.63 Fundamental structure of a traceability system.       62 Aarnisalo K.; Heiskanen S.; Jaakkola K.; Landor E. and Raaska L. (2007) page 15. 63 Moe T. (1998) page 212.   - 37  Traceability can be achieved using either paper based records a bar/scanner system combined with a computerised central database or an integrated IT traceability system that implies among other radio frequency identification (RFID) tags.  3.3.4 Traceable units The concept of traceable units is a key aspect in traceability. A traceable unit must be uniquely identifiable and linked to the relevant records: it can be one fish (e.g. one big halibut) one catch one day�s catch or one week�s catch. It has been the prerogative of the industry to define the appropriate unit64. Trade units logistic units and batches are traceable units defined as in Table 2.  Table 265. Traceable units: trade unit logistic unit batch. - Trade Unit (TU) - any item upon which there is a need to retrieve predefined information and that may be priced or ordered or invoiced at any point in any supply chain. In practice it often refers to the smallest traceable unit that is exchanged between two parties in the supply chain. A crate of fish is often a TU. (image from http://www.fotobank.ru/img/SF15-4519.jpg?size=l)  - Logistic Unit (LU) - an item of any composition established for transport and/or storage that needs to be managed through the supply chain. In practice it is made up by one or more separate TUs. In some cases the trade unit and the logistic unit are the same. A LU is often a pallet of fish being distributed from one producer to a receiver. (image from www.promensfoodpackaging.com/page.asp?pageid=402)      64 Frederiksen M. (2006) 65 http://www.tracefood.org/index.php/GTP:Defining_traceable_units (accessed 01.05.2009).   - 38 - A production batch - has to be referred to when dealing with internal traceability. A production batch is the traceable unit that raw materials and ingredients go into before they are transformed into products placed in new TUs and LUs. Example batch code: - Supplier code/Reception date code/Species code - A/050208/Hd - Haddock supplied by company A on 05.02.2008.  As depicted in Figure 18 batches relate to internal traceability while TUs/LUs relate to external traceability. This distinction is important because globally unique identifiers have to be given to traceable units involved in external traceability (since a production batch is an internal matter it does not need to have a globally unique identifier).   Figure 18.66 Relation between internal batch and external trade unit.  3.3.5 Data recording of unique ID-codes starting from lowest unit To be able to trace both backwards to find origin and forward to find all related units it is vital to record all transformations the lowest TU is subject to. The four steps below specify how to keep track of transformations.67    66 http://www.tracefood.org/index.php/GTP:Defining_traceable_units (accessed 01.05.2009). 67 http://www.tracefood.org/index.php/GTP:Transformations (accessed: 01.05-2009)   - 39 1. Define the TU in the business under examination (e.g. a 20 kg crate with herring). 2. Record IDs of received TUs (raw materials and/or ingredients). Here are two alternatives: a) if the received TU has a unique ID record it; b) if the received TU does not have a unique ID allocate one to it. For an allocation system of unique identification of traceable units see Appendix 6. (e.g. the 20 kg crate with herring was received with the unique ID-code or was given the unique ID-code  (01)07038010000065(8008)040915125603). 3. Record the ID of the TUs that go into the production and give all produced TUs a unique ID. In practice the ID of TUs that goes into production will at that stage be linked to a production batch (cf. Batch number). Every produced TU must be allocated a unique number. In this way the ID of received TUs will be linked with the ID of produced TUs. This practice ensures forward traceability inside the business. Where possible and relevant it is also recommended to record the fraction (%) and/or the net weight of each TU that goes into production. (e.g. the 1 kg net fish weight barrels with marinated herring produced from the received crate of 20 kg of herring will be given an ID-code similar to and related with the crate�s ID-code) 4. Record the ID of all TUs dispatched. Fulfilment of requirements in step 2-4 provides both a link between received and dispatched TUs (and the other way around) via the production process (internal traceability) and a link to previous and next food business operator (external traceability).  Figure 19 shows how relations are linked both ways through a business. For example entire TU 11 is input factor in TU 21 while TU 21 is also made up by TU 12. Both fractions (%) and net weight are indicated. In this figure the production step is removed and only relation between received and dispatched TUs is shown.            - 40  Figure 19.68 Trade units flow.  3.3.6 The importance of weighing Weight accountability is a very important aspect in a fish traceability system as it prevents the infiltration of fish from untraceable provenance usually from IUU activities. In Figure19 the fish net weight received is equivalent with the fish net weight delivered and this was recorded in a data sheet. For example a tuna canning factory receives 5.000 kg of uniquely identified tuna fish crates but delivers cans that contain 7.000 kg of net weight of tuna fish. The question that rises is where do the additional 2.000 kg of tuna fish come from? If no recorded evidence can be found according to applicable legal provisions in order to identify the provenance of the 2.000 kg extra of tuna (no unique ID-codes no catch certificates etc.) then it is clear that the fish has an illegitimate origin.      68 http://www.tracefood.org/index.php/GTP:Transformations (accessed: 01.05-2009).   - 41 3.3.7 Transformations/operations As referred above at each point of the supply chain the traceable units go through different types of operations/transformations. In order to achieve a good traceability of the product the information that is linked to that product must undergo a parallel operation so the product and the information will remain linked. There are 6 main types of operations/transformations connected to traceable units and their linked data. Some of them are more or less exposed and susceptible to infiltration of IUU fishery products or can facilitate for it as exemplified in Table 3. For structuring Table 3 available information from other authors69 was reviewed amended and organised from the new perspective. For examples of the other transformations/operations see Appendix 7.  Table 3. Operations/transformations and their exposure to infiltration with IUU fishery products.  1. Transfer (no joining or splitting of the unit). It is essential that product ID-code is transferred with the product during operation. Example: A truck transports 10 pallets with IDcodes of fresh mackerel from the harbour to the processing unit. The pallets are not changed under transport. IUU fish infiltration: The first buyer after an IUU vessel lands its catch gives his own IDcodes to the fish which will be sold further on as such without any processing further on. If at the upper links of the supply chain the product seems perfectly traceable a deeper investigation to the origin of product will reveal the illegality.         69 Karlsen K.M.; Olsen P. and Stor�y J. (2006) pages 11-12 & Derrick S.; Dillon M. (2004) pages13-14.    - 42 2. Joining (mixing). During this operation one process step combines several traceable units which should have each an unique ID-code. A new ID-code should be established for the new combined TU and the records should clearly indicate the ID-codes of all the component TUs. Example: One processor who receives fish from more than one fishing vessels mixes the cod from the different vessels (one motive might be that the processor does not have sufficient raw material from only one source). The fish received from each vessel should have its own ID-code also the mixed one while the records of the processor should indicate the ID-codes of all the fish that formed the new product with a new ID-code. IUU fish infiltration: Only the fish received from one vessel has ID-codes while the one from the other boats is derived from IUU activities and does not have ID-codes. The processor mixes the fish from all the vessels and gives the new product (the mixed fish) a new ID-code that relates only to the one form the legitimate fishing vessel. In this case checking the weight of the received fish and the delivered one would indicate irregularities and a further investigation will discover the IUU fish.  3. Splitting. During this transformation one traceable unit is split for use in different processes or products. New ID-codes should be given to each of the split units while the records should indicate the ID-code of the origin product. Example: One supplier of cod transports the whole day�s catch with the fishing vessel to the slaughterhouse where the fish is pumped in 3 different basins. Facilitating for IUU fish infiltration: The supplier of cod gives non-unique ID-code to its catch before this is pumped into 3 out of 4 basins and the raw    - 43 material from the basins is given again non-unique ID-codes. The IUU fish pumped by an IUU vessel in the 4th basin receives the same non-unique IDcode as the legitimate fish from basin 3. During the inspection at the landing site the fish from basin 4 is assumed to be legitimate while having the same ID-code as the one in basin 3.  Note that not giving unique ID-codes to any of the trade units in any kind of operation/transformation can immediately and permanently compromise the traceability system as the units can not be either tracked or traced correctly along the custody chain.  3.3.8 Critical traceability control points If the infiltration of IUU fish in the supply chain is seen as a hazard which can be prevented by means of traceability then all the points along the custody chain where the possibility of appearance of the hazard is high can be defined as critical traceability control points. The fish and fish products can enter a legitimate fish supply chain through three different points: at sea at landing and at onshore distribution chain as suggested in Figure 20. This distinction is important as different critical traceability control points can be identified at each IUU fish entrance point.  Figure 20. IUU fish entering points into the legitimate fish supply chain.   - 44 The critical traceability control point (CTCP) can be defined as a step at which the control of traceability can be applied and it is essential to prevent eliminate or reduce the entrance of IUU fish in the legitimate fish supply chain.   In order to identify the CTCP this study proposes the following steps suggested in Figure 21. These steps were designed following the decision tree modelling method.70 In this context step is defined as an operation (e.g. harvesting landing) or transformation (e.g. splitting joining grouping) in the fish supply chain from primary production to final consumption the point in the chain where exists the possibility for mixing of non-IUU fish and IUU fish. Each of the points identified will need traceability controls to ensure that mixing does not occur. Among the CTCP identified after this method there are for example: 1. at sea: fishing harvesting or transhipment operations; 2. at landing: pumping fish from the fishing vessel into basins; 3. at onshore distribution chain: packing crates with fish brought by different fishing vessels or even fish from the same vessel but from a different catch.  Figure 21. Decision tree to identify critical traceability points in the fish supply chain.  70 Miles M.B.; Huberman A.M. (1994) page 185.   - 45 The identification of CTCP along the fish supply chain is important as it indicates the weakest links of the custody chain; the points where the entrance of IUU fish in the legitimate trade could be stopped or reduced by means of traceability.   3.4 Analytical methods used in fish traceability investigations Traceability documentation is the paper trail that must accompany a product and contain all pertinent data to trace its origin and life-history. It includes species ingredients origins manufacturing processes temperature logs etc.71 Full traceability will help to follow up honestly produced and handled products but because they are honestly produced and treated it is not to be expected that they will also be correctly labelled. For example more than one-third of all the fish from the US market is mislabelled for different reasons: hiding IUU fish selling under-utilised fish with a bad image at a higher price profiting on account of legitimate eco-labelled products72. Sometimes the products appear to be perfectly traceable but they are in fact fraudulent in which case fisheries forensics has to be applied.  In traceability investigations the target could be finding the geographical origin of the food/food product (geographical traceability) or to correctly identify the individual animal breed or species (genetic traceability). Analyses performed on a sample to assess whether the product is indeed what the label says are called authentication analyses. The methods used in these analyses can be categorized into: physicochemical techniques (using the variation of the radioactive isotope content of the product spectroscopy pyrolysis or electronic nose) biological techniques (using the analysis of total bacterial flora through many techniques such as Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (DGGE) or DNA chips) biochemical techniques (such as API galleries analysis of antibiotic resistance and ELISA tests) and molecular biological techniques (such as DGGE or Single Strand Conformation of Polymorphism (SSCP)).73 All these methods need the construction of databases with authentic material so that unknown samples can be analysed under the same conditions as the reference material. The results are then statistically analysed to see whether the unknown matches the authentic sample or samples suitable as substitutes or  71 Martinez I. James D. Lor�al H. (2005) page 28. 72 Jacquet J. L.; Pauly D. (2008). 73 Aarnisalo K.; Heiskanen S.; Jaakkola K.; Landor E. and Raaska L. (2007) page 34.   - 46 whether it does not match any of the material included in the database (if a new species is used). In order to reduce the likelihood of not identifying the samples it is useful to have as large a database of known reference material as possible.74  Genetic traceability is based on the identification of both animals and their products through the study of DNA using the four most important features of the DNA molecule: enormous variability among individuals; inalterability during animal life; stability to the different treatments of processed food; it is present in every cell of the organism.  Once the DNA is extracted from the chosen matrix (it can either be fish tissue blood muscle skin or even a processed food such as fish fingers or canned tuna) it is analyzed by molecular markers to obtain a fingerprint or specific allelic frequencies allowing for individual breed or species identification. Since the introduction of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 1989 many different markers have been discovered and studied. At present the most widely used are microsatellites also known as short tandem repeats (STR) and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). The use of these technologies in fish and their products is just an extension of techniques already in use for human testing and routinely applied in forensic casework.75                 74 Martinez I. James D. Lor�al H. (2005) page 37. 75 Dalvit C.; De Marchi M. and Cassandro M. (2007) page 445.   - 47  4. TRACEABILITY AND IUU FISHING DETERRENCE ANALYSIS OF LINKS  4.1 Introduction In order to analyse if the traceability related provisions of EU Regulation 1005/2008 and EU Regulation Proposal 2008/0216 (CNS) are both relevant for IUU fishing deterrence and fulfilling the chain of custody traceability requirements two models were designed. Model 1 was conceived to identify the overlapping of the necessary data for identifying IUU components (actors or products) with the traceability data recorded in the documentation imposed by the legal documents at each critical traceability control point. Model 2 was designed to identify the fulfilment of the chain of custody requirements along the traceability control points. Using the earlier train metaphor the first model analysed if the data stored in the carriages are sufficient/adequate for stopping IUU fish to enter the EU market while the second model analysed if the train track is properly designed to carry the carriages. In both examples the train was attaching new carriages only in the critical traceability control points.  As related issues eco-labelling and genetic traceability aspects were included after the discussion of the models� results.  4.2 Method: description materials premises limitations suggestions 4.2.1 General methodology and materials Due to the complex nature of this research a mixed methods data analysis was used in order to comprise the qualitative data in a quantitative manner.76 The study followed the usual steps of mixed data analysis (data reduction data display and data transformation) where the second step involved the most troublesome decision of choosing a proper graphical display for the designed model.  The models passed through subsequent stages of partially ordered cross-case matrices and case-ordered descriptive matrices until they had reached the final form of case-ordered predictor-outcome N-way matrices. Predictor-outcome matrices align cases on a main outcome or criterion variable and provide data for each case on the main predictor  76 Onwuegbuzie A.J.; Dickinson W.B. (2008) page 205.   - 48 variables thought to be the most important contributors to the outcome.77 This kind of matrices is deemed useful when the analysis has some sort of inferential and explanatory aim rather than just visualization and recognition of patterns. The purpose of this study was not only to barely present the available data comprised in the trade documents and to find a pattern between document cases but to predict if the information will fit a certain purpose. The N-way matrices were thus chosen due to their power to handle the complexity of the clustered predictors and cases included.  The legal material used was the text of EU Regulation 1005/2008) as found in the Official Journal of the European Union and EU Regulation Proposal 2008/0216 (CNS) as found in the Procedure file78 (the original text was corroborated with the Parliament legislative resolution).  4.2.2 Model 1: Acquisition of IUU fishing identification data by means of traceability a. Description and materials The N-way model designed for the identification of overlap of IUU components (actors or products) and traceability data as recorded in the documentation imposed by the Regulations at each critical traceability control point is based on the following series of steps. In order to improve readability some simple examples are given.  1. Identification of the IUU fish entrance points in the legitimate fish supply chain of the associated critical traceability control points and of their linked legally assigned documents. The last item (legally assigned documents) will be displayed in the results matrix in columns clustered according to the IUU fish entrance point. The requirements of these documents form the first set of data that is assessed against the one defined at step 2 of the method (IUU operations identifiers). Example: At the IUU fish entrance point �at sea� one of the critical traceability control points is �the operation of transhipment� while the operation linked document assigned by EU Regulation Proposal 2008/0216 (CNS) is �the transhipment declaration�. The term �transhipment declaration� will be displayed in the results matrix and its data requirements will be assessed in connection with the IUU fishing identifiers.  77 Mile M.B.; Huberman A.M. (1994) page 213. 78 http://www.europarl.europa.eu/oeil/file.jsp?id=5715242 (accessed: 12.05.2009).   - 49 As the display form of the model is a case-ordered predictor-outcome N-way matrix the following steps (2 to 7) define the predictors which are displayed in rows clustered according to their prediction value: IUU fishing deterrence data traceability law jurisdiction and miscellaneous.  2. Designation of the identifiers of the different necessary information for finding IUU operations components. These identifiers are circumscribed by descriptors (the generic class) and parameters (the specific class). These identifiers are derived from fisheries management measures79  and the definitions of IUU fishing80 and IUU fishing vessel81. Example A. Identify the management measure: area X is closed for fishing all year round. Identify the illegal fishing activity: fishing at any time in area X. The identifier is thus a combination of a descriptor (right or wrong place) and a parameter (area of catch). During the control of any of the documents required in the chain of custody it can be scrutinized whether or not the area of catch is right and whether or not the catch is from area X. Example B. Identify the management measure: IUU fishing vessel owners should be excluded from trade. An appropriate descriptor for such identifier could be: bad will vessel owner. Specific parameters for such identifier could be: name of the vessel owner + address of the vessel owner. When a certain vessel is identified as engaged in IUU operations by finding the name of its owner the competent authority of the Member State/third-country involved can exercise its control over nationals engaged in IUU fishing. 3. Inclusion of the unique identification and weighing traceability requirements as definitive components of a properly designed traceability system for fishery products. Each legal document is scrutinized for occurrence of general or specific requirement of assigning unique ID-codes to fish trade units. Further each legal document is scrutinized for adequate inclusion of information on whether the fish has to be weighed on scales approved by competent authorities before entering distribution chain onshore.    79 FAO (2003) and FAO (1997). 80 FAO (2001). 81 EU Regulation 1005/2008 Article 3.   - 50 4. Inclusion of the validation of documents parameter. The validation of documents by a competent authority was assimilated by this study to a second-party certification as defined in Chapter 3.2.3 of this paper. This type of validation grants credibility to the data included in the document. 5. Inclusion of the exemption parameter. Sometimes granting exemptions from legal requirements leads to non-unitary application of the law. If the law is not applicable to all kinds of fishing vessels catch operators and others it may create a loophole that can be exploited by IUU operators. The exact identification of the exemption of the loophole and of how this can be abused by IUU operators falls outside the scope of this study. Example: If the requirement for filling in a transport document has an exemption in a certain case IUU operators may concentrate their transport activities to comply with this exemption. 6. Inclusion of the cross-reference documents parameter. The study will search if the legislation requires that each document issued at any link of the custody chain has to contain a reference to the next document up or down the chain. This requirement it is not essential for traceability but it can facilitate it. Example: If the sales note specifies the number of the catch certificate it will be easier to trace the product. 7. Inclusion of the type of fishing vessel: community vessel (as defined in EU Regulation 1005/2008 Article 2(6): flying the flag of a Member State and registered in the Community); vessels flying the flag of a member state other than Community fishing vessels; third country vessels. This parameter is relevant in order to assess if the legislation applies in a unitary way to all fishing vessels engaged in trade with the Community and to determine the jurisdiction of the norm. 8. Analysis of the link between N- predictors (the IUU operations information identifiers traceability requirements restricted for the purpose of this model to unique identifiers and weighing jurisdiction of the law and miscellaneous) and the requirements for product data imposed for each document by the Regulations. The rating system simple states: �NA� = not applicable; �x�=existent; �\�=non-existent. Examples: If during the analysis it is found that the requirement to state the name of the buyer in the sales note exists in EU Regulation Proposal 2008/0216 (CNS) then the parameter �operator up� will be rated as �x� (existent) in the box where the �sales note� column intersects the �operator up� row. If it is found that the requirement to give unique identification to trade units does not exist in the catch   - 51 certificate the parameter �unique identification� will be rated as �\� (non-existent) in the box where the �catch certificate� column intersects the �unique identification� row. As the existence of VMS on board of a shipping vessel is not related to the cross-reference parameter the later will be rated �NA� in the box where the �advance identification technology� column intersects the �cross-reference to other documents� row.  The model described above was run two times once for the EU Regulation 1005/2008 and once for the EU Regulation Proposal 2008/0216 (CNS) and the relevant Article number is displayed in a N-way matrix.  b. Premises When running the model and interpreting the results some premises related to the interpretation of the legal text should be borne in mind: - in the case of EU Regulation Proposal 2008/0216 (CNS) as indicated by Article 48(4) Principles of monitoring of marketing the provisions of Article 50 Traceability were corroborated with the ones of Articles 14 Logbooks 19 Transhipment declaration 21 Landing declaration 54 Sales notes 57 Take-over declarations and 58 Transport document. Therefore the traceability requirements listed in Article 50 were included in the data requirements for each document. - the specific but not the general requirements of both Regulations were taken into consideration as the two legal texts are of regulatory type rather than guidelines of conduct meant to be fully implemented among the Member States. Example: In order to assess if a comprehensive traceability system was introduced by the EU Regulation Proposal 2008/0216 (CNS) the general requirement of Article 48(2) that reads �All lots of fishery and aquaculture products shall be traceable and the operators shall be able to identify the origin and destination of lots from catching or harvesting to final consumer� was not taken at face value. Instead the specific requirements for traceability systems disseminated along the entire document were assessed for consistency.       - 52 4.2.3 Model 2: Assurance of chain of custody by means of traceability The model designed to define the fulfilment of the chain of custody requirements along the traceability control points is based on the following steps which bear resemblances to the methodology used in Model 1.  As the display form of the model is a case-ordered predictor-outcome N-way matrix step 1 defines the predictors. These are displayed in rows clustered according to their prediction value: control/management system in place confirmation of inputs secure product labelling etc.  1. Identification of the chain of custody requirements. These requirements are circumscribed by descriptors (the generic class) and parameters (the specific class). They were derived from chain of custody documentation used in practice82. 2. Identification of the general critical traceability control points for each of the legal document: at sea at landing and along the onshore distribution chain. Procedures are identical for the two legal texts analyzed. 3. Analysis of the link between the chain of custody requirements and the correspondent legal provision assurance at each general critical traceability control point. The rating system utilized to classify the entries was: �NA� = not applicable; �x�=existent; and �\�=non-existent. If at least for one of the links of the custody chain clustered in accordance to critical traceability control points the parameter requirement was deemed fulfilled the requirement was considered as �existent� for the entire cluster. Example: If it was found that the requirement of a label is fulfilled at the transhipment link the parameter �presence of label� was rated �x� (existent) in the box where the �1. at sea/ EU Regulation Proposal 2008/0216 (CNS)� column intersects the �presence of label� row even though the label might not be required to be present at other links from the same group (catching harvesting).  The model was run simultaneously for both EU Regulation 1005/2008 and EU Regulation Proposal 2008/0216 (CNS).    82 www.us.sgs.com/rd12.pdf (accessed: 05.05.2009); www.msc.org (accessed: 05.05.2009); Olsen P.

This is further highlighted in the Tables by the utilization of different shade codes for the different themes.  1. The IUU operations identification data � do they cover or not all the critical control points? (Or re-visiting the metaphor: does the train stop or not at each station to attach carriages?) 2. The IUU operations identification data � do they exist or not? (The data relevant for IUU operations identification: are they stored in the carriages or not). These are the ratings in the white cells. 3. The IUU operations identification data � are they traceable or not? These are the ratings in the light grey cells; 4. Miscellaneous data related to traceability � do they exist or not? These are the ratings in the medium grey cells. 5. The IUU operations identification data � are they retrieved for all the fishing vessels or not (covering jurisdiction of the norm)? These are the ratings in the dark grey/white font cells.  Acquisition of IUU fishing identification data by means of traceability. Analysis of EU Regulation Proposal 2008/0216 (CNS). Model 1: Table 4.  1. The IUU operations identification data � do they cover all the critical control points or not? The legal text covers all the critical traceability control points at sea and at landing but it covers none of the items at the onshore distribution chain. This exposes the onshore segment to possible infiltration of IUU fish.  2. The IUU operations identification data � do they exist or not? Data are recorded with respect to catch identification (species time area weight of the catch) and are thus relevant for the identification of the IUU fish (wrong species time area). However there are no recorded data that might help assessing if the minimum fish size requirements were violated. This could be inferred (but still not totally proved) if technical specifications of the gear (e.g. hook or mesh size) would have been provided. The provisions of Article   - 58 48(3) were considered irrelevant from this point of view: by knowing only the area of catch no one can say if the fish was of a certain size without assuming that everybody complies with the rules in that area which may not be the case. In addition the fishing licence number is not recorded in any of the documents and this may raise problems in the rapid identification of operators and quotas. Further the recorded data for vessel identification is not consistent throughout the documents and this may cause a problem when the vessel changes its registration name in a manner that facilitates IUU operations. Another weakness is the absence of recorded data with respect to conformity with management and conservation measures. Hence the legal provision is irrelevant with regard to especially unregulated fishing. In addition the data required for identification of operator backwards and downwards are not consistently recorded nor is the operation date. The ability to retrieve related data at each point becomes thus restricted. 3. The IUU operations identification data � are they traceable or not? There are no requirements in place for a unique identification number of the fishery product lots. This absence immediately and permanently hinders the traceability of products. 4. Miscellaneous data related to traceability � do they exist or not? Both the requirement to weigh the products on approved scales at all the critical control points covered by the legal text and the requirement for a computerised validation system are in place. However there are many openings for exemptions from all the requirements considered until now by all parameters and at all the control points covered by the norm hampering thereby the unitary application of the law. Cross-references to other documents are poor preventing the traceability system to work at its maximum. 5. The IUU operations identification data � are they retrieved or not for all the fishing vessels (covering jurisdiction of the norm)? The legal norm covers entirely the community vessels and partly the third country vessels (the later ones are subject to specific provisions in EU Regulation 1005/2008). However it provides no coverage to vessels flying the flag of a Member State other than Community fishing vessels. Hence no data can be retrieved from this kind of vessels under this regulation. If these vessels are engaged in IUU operations the only way to stop them is by the Member state ensuring the control over its nationals; it is therefore important to retrieve the name of the owners of any vessels and to compare it against the existent black lists of IUU operations.     - 59 It is worth noting even though it is not related to the model that while analysing the legal provisions of this text it was realized that the allowable margin of error tolerance in the logbook with regard to volume of fish stored on board was raised from the 5% originally proposed (the European Commission Draft) to 10% (stated in the European Parliament legislative Resolution with respect to the Commission Draft).83 This decision indicates a higher tolerance towards catch that could be otherwise registered as illegal or unreported.  Acquisition of IUU fishing identification data by means of traceability. Analysis of EU Regulation 1005/2008. Model 1: Table 5.  1. The IUU operations identification data � do they cover or not all the critical control points? The legal text covers all the critical traceability control points at sea and at landing but it covers only one such point at the onshore distribution chain. This exposes this last segment to possible infiltration of IUU fish. 2. The IUU operations identification data � do they exist or not (the data relevant for IUU operations identification is it stored in the carriages or not)? The requirements for data retrieval are inconsistent along the critical control points with respect to all parameters other than the weight of the product. This can hinder the traceability of data and products. There are just not enough data linked to the product to assess its non-IUU origin. 3. The IUU operations identification data � are they traceable or no? No single requirement is in place for a unique identification number of the fishery products. This hinders immediately and permanently the traceability of products. 4. Miscellaneous data related to traceability � do they exist or not? The weighing requirement is existent but in an inconsistent manner facilitating thus IUU fish infiltration. Further the validation requirements exist only in two cases and the credibility of the operations becomes questionable. Cross-references to other documents are scant preventing the traceability system to work at its best level. On the other hand the law does not provide many exemptions ensuring therefore a more unitary application. 5. The IUU operations identification data � are they retrieved or not for all the fishing vessels (covering jurisdiction of the norm)? The legal norm covers entirely the Community vessels and the third country vessels. But again it fails to cover the vessels flying the flag of a Member State other than Community�s fishing vessels.  83 European Parliament legislative resolution of 22 April 2009 (T6-0255/2009) at http://www.europarl.europa.eu/oeil/file.jsp?id=5715242 (accessed: 09.05.2009).   - 60 4.3.3 Model 2: Assurance of chain of custody by means of traceability results The results displayed in Table 6 can be interpreted from one perspective: are any chain of custody requirements included in EU Regulation 1005/2008 and EU Regulation Proposal 2008/0216 (CNS)? The overall outcome is that with some few exceptions there are no such requirements incorporated in the legal text. As a consequence �black fish� has the possibility to infiltrate into the legitimate trade. The analysis reveals that there are some rules in both legal texts that lay a certain basis for a chain of custody (e.g. the designation of the responsible authority; the keeping of records for a minimum of X years) but they are only isolated cases. Moreover the EU Regulation Proposal 2008/0216 (CNS) is a step ahead of EU Regulation 1005/2008 by imposing the existence of a label requirement.                           - 61  5. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS  5.1 Discussion 5.1.1 The Models Though designed to address various purposes of the new Common Fisheries Policy the aim of the Regulations was allegedly the ambition to put up a comprehensive traceability system as a management tool to deter IUU fishing activities. Both EU Regulation 1005/2008 and EU Regulation Proposal 2008/0216 (CNS) are regulatory type norms to be obligatorily incorporated into in the legal system of all member states. Therefore their provisions have to be clear and specific.  The aim of this study was to assess if the legal requirements fit the purpose of the law that is if the evidence found in the texts indicates a comprehensive traceability system or not. This is a novel approach to both EU Regulation 1005/2008 and EU Regulation Proposal 2008/0216 (CNS) from a dual perspective: IUU fishing deterrence and traceability. So far extensive studies have been carried out to assess the impact of the first norm on EU trade with third parties particularly developing countries (e.g. Tsamenyi M. et al. (2009) � Fairer Fishing? The Impact on developing countries of the European Community Regulation on IUU Fisheries; Tsamenyi M. et al. (2008) � Development impact of the Council Regulation establishing a European Community system to prevent IUU fishing on Commonwealth ACP Member countries). Within the EU some research is also being done with respect to the operational implementation of the same norm (e.g. Larsen E.P. (2009) � Traceability in the Danish fish sector). The question of the applicability of the laws still stands as little or no research seems to be published on this subject. Nevertheless the clarification of this particular issue was not an objective that the present study set out to analyse.  The two models suggested here are preliminary and both may need further refinement. Model 1 �Acquisition of IUU fishing identification data by means of traceability� could be made more comprehensive. For this purpose the analysis of the catch documents proposed by RFMOs could be included as Article 13 Regulation 1005/2008 assimilates them to the catch certificates defined in Article 12. To gain profoundness more IUU fishing data identifiers could be specified. Moreover identifiers could be divided into several   - 62 categories: technical identifiers trade operators� identifiers vessel identifiers or others in order to improve detail. Model 2 �Assurance of chain of custody by means of traceability� could gain resolution if each group of general critical traceability points was broken down into more specific components like �at sea: catching transhipment�. This would improve clarity and accuracy. The chain of custody parameters could also be disaggregated into subcomponents in order to improve depth of analysis.  In spite of their limitations both Model 1 and 2 could be used to analyse and rate accordingly any legal text that puts into place a traceability system for the fish supply chain. Moreover Model 1 could be used not only for analysing a legal norm but also be applied to any singular document required at critical traceability control points. In a similar way Model 2 could be used to analyse a self-standing traceability system implemented by any company. Because the rating system is straightforward as existence and non-existence are not matters of interpretation but of strict identification both models are replicable. Thus anyone following the named method should achieve identical results provided that the same predictors are used and identical requirements of the chain of custody are adopted.  The comprehensive display and the multitude of inferences that can be made are probably the strongest assets of the models used. Nevertheless at some point their wideness and depth could be also the weakest asset as the multiple-entry format may seem intricate to some. However being a three fold study (IUU fishing traceability EU law) the chosen method seems to be appropriate as it enables the integration of all the data in a readable predictable and parsimonious manner.  Based on the results of Model 1 this study reveals that the data necessary for identification of the IUU fish and operators is not constantly recorded at each critical traceability point by the documents required by EU Regulation Proposal 2008/0216 (CNS) and EU Regulation 1005/2008. Thus the data traceability scheme can only deficiently if hardly be used in the deterrence of IUU operations. Moreover the unique identification requirement does exist neither in EU Regulation Proposal 2008/0216 (CNS) nor in EU Regulation 1005/2008. Thus the system fails to fulfil the mandatory requirement of a traceability scheme.     - 63 Based on the results of Model 2 this study reveals that the traceability system put in place by EU Regulation 1005/2008 and EU Regulation Proposal 2008/0216 (CNS) does not fulfil the chain of custody requirements. It is thus also deemed weak and useless for deterrence of IUU fishing.  5.1.2 Eco-labelling and IUU fish traceability As presented in Chapter 3.2.4 of this paper the eco-labelling certification process consists of two steps: fishery certification and chain of custody certification of all individual companies that will use the eco-label logo on their products. During the first step the certification body assures inter alia that the fishery and actors are not engaged in IUU operations. Therefore an eco-labelled certified fishery is to be assumed exempt of IUU fishing and products originating from it are deemed non-IUU commodities. The information gathered during the pre-pre-assessment and pre-assessment phases of this step could be used by public authorities to define their strategies with respect to IUU fishing84.  During the second step the certification body verifies that a certified product originates from a certified fishery and is not mixed with non-certified products. This will ensure that �black fish� will not be mixed with the �white� one at any point of the custody chain. In the end the consumer buying an eco-labelled product is to remain assured that the purchased fish is not coming from IUU operations.  Most of the eco-labelling schemes have chain of custody certification requirements but they are either weak or too general with the exception of the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) scheme.85 This scheme defines parameters to be checked by the certification body and only if the requirements of these parameters are fulfilled at all individual companies along the chain of custody the certification is awarded. In practice the representative of the certification body should visit on site all the individual companies along the custody chain not only their head quarters and check all the requirements of the chain of custody certification.  In this context the most important challenges for eco-labels schemes to ensure the traceability of the chain of custody and helping deter IUU fishing would be:  84 Carleton C. (2009) pages 12-13. 85 Olsen P. (2009) 2 page 17.   - 64 - Developing measurable standards for chain of custody certification. In this respect there are examples of efficient and non-efficient practice. For instance the standards of �Friend of the sea� are non-measurable � e.g. �The Organization guarantees that a specific traceability system is in place in order to demonstrate that the product audited respects all requirements of this Standard and there is no possibility of mix with other products not under certification.�86 On the contrary the standards of MSC seem measurable � e.g. �Sales invoice able to be linked to certified products and batches�.87 - Make sure that the certification body assesses all the involved individual companies on site.  5.1.3 Authentication/genetic traceability and IUU fishing deterrence Identifying the species to which a fish sample or product belongs is maybe the first application of genetic traceability. Often used to discover mislabelled products the species authentication combined with conventional traceability can actually indicate the IUU fish. For example if the product is labelled as swordfish but is identified to be mako shark this is a case of mislabelling. If the investigation checks the documents that followed the product along the custody chain it may be discovered that in the catch area it is legal to catch swordfish but not mako sharks. In this case the genetic trace would be necessary together with conventional traceability to identify IUU fish.  With regard to fish stocks (exploited populations of a commercial species) and identification88 of their geographic origin even the most advanced techniques of genetic analysis may not always provide unequivocal evidence. Genetic variation among populations reflects levels of gene exchange among spawning stocks and in principle it is possible to allocate fish to the right stock of origin even if only in a probabilistic sense. A complication may arise however when fish form e.g. feeding aggregations. These may be composed of multiple evolutionary populations a mixture that is often found. Consequently molecular markers may be used to trace an individual salmon to the specific river drainage where it hatched but not to where it was caught. Therefore the method can  86 Friend of the Sea fishery check list at http://host1.bondware.com/~fos/news.php?viewStory=74 (accessed: 09.05.2009). 87 Application form for MSC �Chain of Custody� Certification developed by MacAlister Elliott and Partners Ltd (http://www.macalister-elliott.com/msc_certification/; accessed: 09.05.2009). 88 Ogden R. (2008) page 466.   - 65 hardly be used to detect IUU provenience with regard to area of catch gear used time of catch and other controls. Vary often genetic identification techniques can simply not reveal these data. An additional flaw of genetic analysis is that it is sometimes difficult to resolve �true� independent stock units. This is the case when even small amounts of gene flow between stocks blur their genetic make-up.89 This is not infrequent even for stocks that were positively identified as possessing separated spawning populations by means of other classical methods. In this case it may be difficult to prove both the area of catch and the stock origin.  On the other hand genetic traceability90 at any point in the food supply chain is restricted to demonstrating product receipt from one stage up in the chain and product provision to one stage down in the chain. This logic removes the requirement for molecular genetic markers to identify samples; instead they can be employed to exclude samples. Exclusion is simpler than identification as it does not require the same level of comparative population data or statistical interpretation. By screening a batch of fish at any point in the supply chain subsequent adulteration can be detected by resampling. This can help uncover genetic material that was not present in the original batch. Dense supply chain sampling allows identification of the exact point at which illegal fish entered the chain. From a practical fisheries perspective such methods would not use DNA markers for tracing individual fish but instead use markers that characterize the genetic variation found within approved fisheries. For example microsatellite panels currently used to identify farmed salmon broodstock from different suppliers could also be used to demonstrate changes in the genetic composition of a batch of fish as it becomes infiltrated with IUU products along the supply chain. The scale of sampling required would then be restricted to that typically used to provide a comprehensive estimate of allele frequencies in a population genetic study. In addition to enabling enforcement authorities to investigate IUU activity genetic tracing also provides a method that can be employed by the fisheries industry or independent certification schemes to demonstrate the source of specific products.     89 ICES WGAGFM (2009) page 11. 90 Ogden R. (2008) page 468.   - 66 The EU Regulation Proposal 2008/0216 (CNS) took into consideration all these aspects. But owing to the cost entailed by traceability tools such as genetic analysis it was decided for the moment to only carry out pilot projects that broaden the research and information base for future measures (Article 13 New Technologies).  5.1.4 Facilitating the traceability of fishery products In order to facilitate the usage of traceability as a management tool in deterrence of IUU operations some measures could be implemented including:  � The introduction of internationally coordinated customs codes.91 Where a species subject to international trade is threatened by IUU fishing the introduction of this kind of codes would enable a more accurate assessment of the trade. Also improved coordination of product-specific codes between countries engaged in the trade of a species would greatly assist in reducing the errors in converting processed weights to live weight. � The development of clear parameterised international standards of fish/fishery traceability (an example of such standard developed at EU level is CEN/CWA 14660:2003-Traceability of fishery products: Specification on the information to be recorded in captured fish distribution chains). � Wherever possible the conventional traceability system should be backed up by authentication/genetic traceability. � The problem of transhipment must be addressed seriously and actively because it is a very weal link in the chain of custody. Port States should be more demanding with regard to accountability of landings. Where fish being landed or trafficked lacks full accountability by internationally recognized standards the whole operation should be treated as suspicious. Even if the fish unaccounted for represents just a part of the total volume. � Real time update of IUU fishing black/white lists. � Monitoring systems should be improved for example by ensuring that devices cannot be disabled or the data tampered with.92 � Catch documentation schemes should be implemented more widely together with trade documentation schemes. It should be ensured that documentation accompany the fish in  91 OECD (2004) page 73. 92 OECD (2004) page 391.   - 67 trade starting from the point it is caught all the way through the time it reaches the consumer. These systems should be implemented with priority in important markets (Japan Chinese Taipei) and ports especially ports of convenience (Las Palmas Spain; Port Louis Mauritius).93  5.2 Conclusions Primary analyses:  � Novel and comprehensive methods were developed to analyse the connexion between IUU fishing deterrence and the fish traceability scheme put in place by the EU Regulation 1005/2008 and EU Regulation Proposal 2008/0216 (CNS) using the caseordered predictor-outcome N-way matrix method. � Although replicable the models developed are preliminary and further refinement can improve their applicability. � Neither EU Regulation 1005/2008 nor EU Regulation Proposal 2008/0216 (CNS) has the power to effectively use traceability to deter IUU fishing:  the traceability system set up is not viable as it lacks the uniqueidentification requirement;  the product data required by law is either insufficient or irrelevant to scrutinize IUU fishing actors or products;  the law does not assure the chain of custody traceability. � Further studies can improve the suggested model under a de lege ferenda approach i.e. designing a traceability system that can effectively be used in deterrence of IUU operations. � Eco-labelling of fish products is a viable way of deterring IUU fishing through its fishery certification and chain of custody components provided that measurable standards for chain of custody certification are developed and the certification body assesses all the involved individual companies on site. � Genetic traceability/authentication alone although promising still has moderate applicability in the deterrence of IUU operations. To improve effectiveness it must be used complementarily with the conventional traceability systems.  93 OECD (2004) page 392.   - 68  genetic traceability of the species/stocks is the easiest and clear application of this tool in IUU fishing deterrence;  fish stock and geographic origin identification by means of genetic traceability are not conclusive for identification of IUU fish;  genetic traceability at any point in the food supply chain may be an application that facilitates IUU fish identification provided that a genetic database of reference exists;  the EU Regulation Proposal 2008/0216 (CNS) takes into account the new genetic technologies but owing to their cost these are still not operational.  Related findings:  � The provisions EU Regulation Proposal 2008/0216 (CNS) regarding the logbook are insufficient to deal with unreported fishing. � The provisions of EU Regulation 1005/2008 and EU Regulation Proposal 2008/0216 (CNS) leave outside their jurisdiction fishing vessels flying a flag of a Member State other than Community vessels. � The multitude of exemptions offered by both legal texts may easily lead to a nonunitary application of the law. � The introduction of internationally coordinated customs codes and the development of clear parameterised international standards of fish/fishery traceability are just a few examples of fishery management measures that can be taken to facilitate the traceability of fisheries products.              - 69  REFERENCES  � Aarnisalo K.; Heiskanen S.; Jaakkola K.; Landor E. & Raaska L.

Among developing countries there is a growing concern that the overcapacity problems of developed countries will spill over into IUU fishing activities. Not offering scrapping incentives can also drive vessels-owners into IUU fishing. b. degree of MCS operations and their effect. The high cost of an efficient MCS system can hinder coastal states especially the developing countries to ensure the legal compliance in their EEZs. c. level of sanctions against IUU fishing. Limited enforcement and the absence of severe penalties can transform IUU fishing in a very profitable activity. The forfeiture of vessels and catch could sometimes be more of an impediment to IUU fishing than fines. d. management regimes. Countries with weak fisheries management regimes are more often a source of vessels for IUU operations than the ones with strong fisheries management. e. weak international legal framework. Voluntary binding soft international legislation or the lack of any legal provisions (e.g. safety and personnel requirements for fishing vessels etc.) tax havens open vessels registries all these are incentives for IUU fishing activities. f. unsatisfactory economical and social conditions of fishers. Poor livelihood conditions particularly in developing countries influence fishers to engage in IUU activities. g. market and value of the IUU fish. Most of the species targeted by IUU activities have a very high market value; therefore the economic gains from IUU fishing are often substantial.           95 OECD (2005) pages 37-40.   - 75 APPENDIX 396 Available measures against IUU fishing activities All countries - States should ratify international legal instruments related to fisheries. - Countries whose vessels take part in fisheries regulated by RFMOs should become members of those organizations or make their vessels fish in such a way that they do not undermine the rules created by those organizations. - Each country should review its own fishing laws and practices to see if they enable the use of all relevant tools in the IPOA-IUU. - Countries should improve their MCS capacity and participate in the International Network for the Cooperation and Coordination of Fisheries-Related Monitoring Control and Surveillance Activities. - Governments can encourage fishers to comply with fishing rules through positive actions (community education and other outreach to fishers; ensuring that stakeholders participate in the development of fishery rules; fostering peer pressure in favour of compliance; creating systems for collecting information that are easy for fishers to use). - Countries should eliminate subsidies and other economic support which contribute to the build-up of excess fishing capacity. - States have to take measures or cooperate to ensure that their nationals do not support or engage in IUU fishing. Flag countries (countries that register fishing vessels and authorize vessels to fly their flags) - The State has responsibility under international law to control the fishing activities of both fishing vessels and fishing support vessels (such as transport vessels that receive the catch of fishing vessels and supply vessels that bring fuel and provisions to fishing vessels) no matter where the vessel operates. - The State should ensure before it registers a fishing vessel that it can exercise its responsibility to control that the vessel does not engage in IUU fishing. - The States should ensure that there is a strong link between the process by which they register fishing vessels and the process by which they grant authorizations to fish. - The States should register as many fishing vessels as possible preferably all of them and to enter all of them on its record of fishing vessels. - The States should require all chartering arrangements to be fully transparent. - The State should issue an authorization to fish only to a vessel properly registered in its territory and entered in its record of fishing vessels. - The States should prohibit their vessels from engaging in transshipment of fish at sea without prior authorization issued by the flag State. Coastal countries (countries that border ocean areas) - The State should: keep a record of foreign vessels authorized to fish in its waters; require foreign vessels to use VMS such that the coastal country has real-time or near real-time access to vessel positions and receives regular data reports by VMS; require foreign vessels or a certain percentage of them to carry independent observers.   96 Based on FAO (2002) 1 and FAO (2002) 2.   - 76 - The coastal State should request the flag State to guarantee that its vessels being licensed do not have a history of IUU fishing before licenses are issued by the coastal State. - Coastal countries should consider requiring that all trans-shipments take place in port or at a minimum require that trans-shipment at sea ought to be done in accordance with proper controls and at locations where inspectors can be present to check the details of the fish being trans-shipped. - A coastal State must work closely with other States and RFMOs on different levels. - The state should improve its MCS efforts. Port countries (countries to whose ports fishing vessels come) - A port State should require foreign fishing vessels seeking port access to provide at a minimum: reasonable advance notice of their entry into port; a copy of their authorization to fish; details of their fishing trip and quantities of fish on board. - If a port country has reasonable grounds for suspecting that a vessel in its port has engaged in IUU fishing the port country should: not allow the vessel to land or trans-ship fish in its port; immediately report the matter to the flag country and if the suspected IUU fishing may have taken place in another country�s waters or in waters regulated by a regional fishery organization immediately report the matter to that country or organization. Regional Fishery Management Organizations Among things that regional fishery organizations can do are to: - collect and disseminate information relating to IUU fishing; - identify vessels that are engaging in IUU fishing and coordinate measures against them; - identify countries whose vessels are engaging in IUU fishing and can urge identified countries to correct such behaviour; - call on their members to take action against vessels without nationality that are fishing in the relevant region; - adopt rules to ensure that vessel chartering arrangements do not lead to IUU fishing; - adopt port inspection schemes restrictions on trans-shipment at sea and schemes creating a presumption that fish harvested by nonmember vessels in the relevant region should not be permitted to be landed in ports of members; - adopt catch certification and/or trade documentation schemes; - adopt other market-related measures to combat IUU fishing. National Plans of Action  The IPOA-IUU calls upon all countries to develop and adopt national plans of action to further achieve the objectives of the IPOA-IUU. Each country�s national plan of action should at least consider how each of the basic tools could be put to use in the fisheries in which it is involved. Market/Trade measures - Market-related measures cover several types of controls on the importation and exportation of goods including: catch certification and trade documentation requirements; import and export restrictions and prohibitions; improvement of the transparency of their markets to allow the traceability of fish or fish products; eco-labelling.       - 77 APPENDIX 4.

Furthermore a minimum of additional information has to be linked to the traceable units throughout their lifetime. Later on these data may be accessed via the unique identification number. Common practice for creation of the smallest traceable unit varies in different industries. In the fish farming business a bucket of roe a full containment of a well boat or a fish crate are typical TUs. In the capture fish sector a crate of fish is a typical TU.  The GS1100 numbering system  GS1 administers a global number system for identification and description of items. Traceability standards recommend the use of the GS1 numbers for unique identification for TUs and LUs. The concept of the GS1 128 symbology is to code a set of data elements frequently used in trade and logistic (i.e. Net weight Production date etc) and explain the meaning of the data elements by using a prefix called an Application Identifier (AI). Hence the AI identifies the meaning and the format of the data that follows it (data field). In the example data (3101) 05545 3101 is the Application Identifier telling that this data element means Net weight with an accuracy of one decimal and 05545 specifies the Net weight to be 5545 Kg.  The GS1 128 Symbology provides adequate predefined data elements to enable unique identification of both Trade Unit and Logistic Unit.  Uniquely identifying the Logistic Unit  GS1 provides a globally unique data element for the identification of a Logistic Unit called SSCC (Serial Shipping Container Code). A pallet of fish crates or 20 meters containers of fish are typical logistic units. Traceability standards require that the IDs of  99 http://www.tracefood.org/index.php/GTP:Unique_Identification (accessed: 01.05.2009). 100 GS1 is a global organization which main activity is the development of the GS1 System a series of standards designed to improve supply chain management. The GS1 Identification System provides two types of identifiers. The first or primary identifiers are called GS1 Keys like the Global Trade Item Number (GTIN) or Global Location Number (GLN). (www.gs1.com accessed: 02.05.2009).   - 80 the separate TU�s within the LU shall be linked to the LU identifier in practice to the SSCC.  The SSCC number structure is (00) 235467985462312345 were 00 is the Application Identifier and the following figure is an 18 digit unique number.  Uniquely identifying the Trade Unit  The GS1 128 Symbology does not have one single data element for the unique identification of a Trade Unit (i.e. a particular fish crate). However the symbology provides a trade item number named GTIN which identifies a variant of Trade Units (i.e. crate of 20 Kg fresh Superior Atlantic salmon of 4-5 kg each fish). GTIN is an abbreviation for Global Trade Item Number.  To uniquely identify the particular crate one has to add one or more predefined data elements. In the traceability standards this identifier is called GTIN+ where the + indicates that additional information is needed for this purpose.  To make up the GTIN+ the GTIN (AI 01) must be combined either with a Batch number (AI 10) and a Serial number (AI 21) or only with the Date and time of production (AI 8008).  GS1 defines the Batch number as an internal number of a production batch. It is common practice to allocate this number to all produced units with similar properties (i.e. origin / farm area time of arrival supplier etc) and/or produced within a certain time period (i.e. one hour a shift one day one week etc). Since most commonly many Trade Units are given the same Batch number unique identification of each separate Trade Unit demands further specification. An appropriate solution is to allocate a Serial Number to each produced Trade Unit (i.e. a meat crate).  Using example data the GTIN+ applying the Batch- and Serial number looks as follows:  (01)07038010000065(10)123456(21)1234567890    - 81 The second alternative is to make up a unique identification of a Trade Unit by combining the GTIN and Date and Time of production (AI 8008).  Exemplified with real data GTIN+ may be presented as follows:  (01)07038010000065(8008)040915125603  The figures behind AI (8008) have a structured format meaning year/ month/ time/ minute/ second.  In some cases a Logistic Unit and a Trade Unit will be of equal size (i.e. a full containment of a cargo boat carrying grain).                         - 82 APPENDIX 7101. Additional types of operations/transformations of traceable units and their linked data. 1. Addition. During processing additional ingredient(s) are added to the product. Since the ID-code is still unique to the product it is continued to be used although the processing records should identify the ID-code(s) of the ingredient(s) used. Example: Brining operation. The same ID-code would be kept by the fish after this process step although the processing records would show the ID-code of the salt used to produce the brine (as well as brine strength time pf processing etc.)  3. Grouping. Trade units are grouped in a logistic unit. The ID-codes of the separate TU�s within the LU shall be linked to the LU identifier. Example: A slaughterhouse has defined the day�s production of slaughtered salmon as a batch. The batch is splitted to be packed in crates (TUs) and the crates are arranged on pallets (LUs).  4. Un-grouping. Logistic trades are un-grouped in trade units. The ID-codes of the separate TUs from within the LU have to be linked to the LU identifier. Example: A slaughterhouse produces pallets (LUs) with crates (TUs) of 3-4 kg and 5-6 kg fresh salmon. The LUs are transported to a distribution terminal. One client wants 5? pallets with crates of 3-4 kg and 3? pallets with crates of 5-6 kg. The pallets are un-packed the crates counted and packed again.    101 Based on Karlsen K.M.; Olsen P. and J.

In order to be able to design relevant visualisations for this study the qualitative data (i.e. the HDAs and their corresponding variables) were exported from NVivo 11 to Microsoft Excel 2016. They were transformed using Python into a data format (source-to-target) adequate for import into Gephi (Version 0.9.1) which is an open source visualisation tool for graph and network analysis (Bastian Heymann & Jacomy 2009). This program allows for visual analytics and functions as a complementary tool to perform enumeration to enable visual thinking and to facilitate reasoning. In particular Gephi was used for qualitative and quantitative visualisation of the hierarchy and the connections between the HDAs and the variables as shown in Figure 1. To give a qualitative representation of how the HDAs were modelled the HDAs and variables were represented as nodes and the connections between them as edges while the colour of each node was set according to the dimension that was assigned to the variable. The colours were assigned as follows: pink: human; blue: economic; green: environmental; white: other (e.g. time) or more than one dimension (e.g. sustainability). To include a quantitative representation of the results the size of the nodes was set according to the publication count (i.e. the overall number of sources that featured this variable) which gives an impression of the relative importance of each. Each HDA in the study was treated separately and a visual representation was created for each. The network algorithm used in Gephi was ForceAtlas2 (Jacomy Venturini Heymann & Bastian 2014).

2022 VANHEE BORIT Ethical by designer How to grow ethical designers of aritifical intelligence.pdf,Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research 73 (2022) 619-631 Submitted 06/2021; published 02/2022 Viewpoint: Ethical By Designer How to Grow Ethical Designers of Artificial Intelligence Lo�s Vanh�e (Corresponding author) lois.vanhee@umu.se Ume� Universitet Department of Computing Science Linnaeus v�g 49 907 36 Ume� Sweden Melania Borit melania.borit@uit.no UiT The Arctic University of Norway Norwegian College of Fisheries Science Muninbakken 21 9019 Troms� Norway Abstract Ethical concerns regarding Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology have fueled discussions around the ethics training received by AI designers. We claim that training designers for ethical behaviour understood as habitual application of ethical principles in any situation can make a significant difference in the practice of research development and application of AI systems. Building on interdisciplinary knowledge and practical experience from computer science moral psychology and development and pedagogy we propose a functional way to provide this training. 1. Introduction Against the backdrop of the challenges posed by ethical dilemmas of Artificial Intelligence (AI) spanning from bias in AI systems (Lee 2018) to manipulation of human judgement (Henriksen 2019) virtue ethics understood as an approach to normative ethics that emphasizes moral character in contrast to approaches that emphasize duties and rules (deontology) or consequences of actions (consequentialism) (Carr 2008; Hursthouse 2017) becomes increasingly important in the debate around the impact AI will have on society. Virtue ethics gain attention as current tertiary education seems to fail in developing professional ethics and social responsibility skills (Chang Shih & Chang 2020) codes of ethics are not drivers of ethical behaviour in moral exemplars in computing (Huff & Furchert 2014) and developers� compliance with the principles set out in the various ethical guidelines is poor (McNamara Smith & Murphy-Hill 2018). While moving away from preaching rules to focusing on cultivating the developers� character dispositions and moral attitude is a sensible advice (Harris 2008) how to follow it is not straightforward either for educators or for learners. We believe that an interdisciplinary approach integrating knowledge and experience from computer science moral psychology and development and pedagogy can provide a way for "broadening the scope of action uncovering blind spots promoting autonomy and freedom and fostering self-responsibility" (Hagendorff 2020) - that is training for ethical behaviour understood as habitual application of ethical principles in any situation (Trevi�o Weaver & Reynolds 2006) (e.g. routinely record anonymisation procedures in data mining activities involving personal data). �2022 AI Access Foundation. All rights reserved. Vanh�e & Borit Thus to those interested in becoming the kind of AI systems developers that the society needs and to those willing to contribute with training such developers we propose using the GEDAI framework - Growing Ethical Designers of Artificial Intelligence. This framework is based on an integrative curricular strategy that is consistent with approaches that make the ethical and value aspects explicit as a part of the design process (Shilton 2013 2014 2018; Shilton & Anderson 2017; Spiekermann 2019). However implementing our GEDAI framework in teaching and learning practices will mark a shift from achieving ethics for design(ers) (i.e. action-restriction through strict regulation of practice) (Dignum 2019) to achieving ethics by designers - that is empower AI systems developers to act self-responsibly in situations where morally relevant decisions have to be made. In the following we describe this framework and the way in which we envisage its use. 2. Description of the GEDAI Framework We have chosen to conceptualize our ideas of integrating teaching ethical behaviour within teaching AI practices in the form of a framework that is the GEDAI framework. The elements of the GEDAI framework and the relationship between them are visualized in Figure 1. The GEDAI framework builds on four core principles: A) Ethical Behaviour (EB) is a central concept in virtue ethics and it is rooted in the social condition and the human psyche (Rest Bebeau & Volker 1986). As such GEDAI proposes growing EB using advances in the domain of moral psychology and development. Within this domain the Four Component Model of Moral Behavior (Narvaez & Rest 1995) is the most studied and applied. This model introduces four dimensions along which individual moral ability and behavior can be grown: moral sensitivity moral judgement moral motivation and implementation also referred to as moral action. Moral sensitivity captures the ability to observe the morally-sensitive aspects from raw observations (e.g. emotions ramifications of decisions). Moral judgement captures the ability to decide upon the most sensitive course of conduct when facing a morally loaded situation. Moral motivation captures the inclination of fulfilling moral duties over other dimensions. Moral action captures the ability for actually implementing a moral decision including performative ability and psychological resilience. B) Teaching ethical behaviour to AI systems developers can be operationalised using Intended Learning Outcomes (ILOs). Being statements about what a learner will achieve upon successful completion of an instructional unit (IU) ILOs are expressed from the learners� perspective and are measurable achievable and assessable. As such GEDAI advocates for defining specific ILOs for learning ethical behaviour. C) Ethical behaviour is a transferable skill and as such it can be integrated with the practices of teaching AI. Ethics education in a professional context has tended to follow one of three basic models: a dedicated ethics course offered by a humanities & social science department as a requirement or an elective; a dedicated ethics course within the discipline as a requirement or an elective; or ethics content integrated into one or more core courses. We believe that teaching ethical behaviour can and should be smoothly integrated in regular AI IUs be they individual sessions modules courses or programs as integration as a strategy for developing transferable skills is proven to be more effective in higher education 620 Ethical By Designer Continue if satisfactory 1.

Pedagogical theory and research Figure 1: GEDAI - Growing Ethical Designers of Artificial Intelligence framework. Squares represent actions; circles represent inputs/outputs. The yellow highlighted items represent the distinctive elements that integrate teaching ethical behaviour in the AI teaching and learning process. Intra- and interphases loops are not displayed. 621 Vanh�e & Borit as it is more representative of the real-life application of skills in the workplace (Cottrell 2001). However the GEDAI framework is still applicable in cases where a dedicated ethics course within the discipline is used. D) Learners construct ethical behaviour meaning habits and expertise through relevant learning activities while teachers� task is to set up a learning environment that supports these learning activities. As such GEDAI uses the constructive alignment educational principle (Biggs & Tang 2011) to the design of IUs that integrate AI and ethical behaviour teaching. According to this approach ILOs are identified then assessment tasks are designed to measure the attainment of these ILOs followed by planning learning activities and choosing content required to support these learning activities. The main elements of the teaching and learning process depicted by the GEDAI framework are phases actions and inputs/outputs. These phases are: 1) Operationalizing ILOs; 2) Planning of IU; 3) Implementing activities; 4) Refining IU. Whereas being presented here in a sequential order for facilitating understanding these actions and phases are to be undertaken in loops where actions/phases can overlap or a specific action/phase can trigger a revision of the previous one(s) (i.e. intra- and interphases loops). For example once a concrete activity plan is defined at the end of Phase 2 action d framework users are invited to reconsider the set of ILOs to be covered and that were defined in Phase 1 actions a and b. In Phase 1 (Operationalizing ILOs) the framework user has the task to specify ILOs suitable for the respective IU starting from higher level ILOs (actions a and b in Figure 1). In the case of AI such high level outcomes can be found in program descriptions and educational plans issued by the Association for Computing Machinery and the IEEE Computer Society or similar documents. In the case of EB besides program descriptions educational plans and similar documents scientific publications bring a significant contribution; (see for example Martin Huff Gotterbarn & Miller 1996; Martin & Weltz 1999; Martin & Huff 1997; Werth 1997; Harris Jr Davis Pritchard & Rabins 1996; Callahan 1980; Huff & Frey 2005; Frey 2010; Lennerfors Laaksoharju Davis Birch & Fors 2020). The task to specify AI ILOs (action a) using Bloom�s taxonomy is already a common practice (see for example Manaris Wainer Kirkpatrick Stalvey Shannon Leventhal Barnes Wright Schafer & Sanders 2007) or Sobral (2021). However in the case of EB ILOs (action b) this specification of IU-specific EB ILOs from the general literature is not clear. Thus here we propose using the Integrative Ethical Education Model (Narvaez & Lapsley 2008; Narvaez & Bock 2014) further operationalised and supplemented with examples of assessment and activities in the Ethical Expertise Model (Narvaez 2009; Narvaez & Lies 2009; Narvaez & Endicott 2009; Narvaez & Bock 2009). These educational models build on the Four Component Model of Moral Behaviour explained above in Principle A and are based on evidence that such behaviour can be fostered by training ethical expertise (Huff 2014; Narvaez 2010) which is best gained through a novice-to-expert approach that moves through several stages of instruction while blending well-educated intuitions and good reasoning. In Phase 2 (Planning instructional unit) the framework user has the difficult task to integrate the two sets of operationalised ILOs and specify ILOs for the respective IU and contextualize these ILOs (action c). GEDAI chooses to use an integrative strategy to teaching ethical behaviour as a transferable skill (i.e. skills are developed and taught explicitly within 622 Ethical By Designer the core discipline with equal emphasis given to transferable skills and technical abilities) as opposed to embedding (i.e. no direct reference is made to developing transferable skills and the emphasis is on promoting the development of technical �know-how�) or bolting-in (i.e. skills are developed independently of the core discipline enabling the explicit development of learners� transferable skills) (Chadha 2006). This integrative approach is considered to be more effective in higher education as it is more representative of the real-life application of skills in the workplace (Cottrell 2001). Several inputs play a role in action c (items III-VII in Figure 1) and the user has to be skilled in combining knowledge from various domains: AI in theory and in practice for example contents of well established handbooks such as Russell and Norvig (2002) as well as new trends such as autonomous cars; pedagogy - for example how to establish the position of the IU at mastery familiarity or exposure level (McDonald & McDonald 1999) or the use of the Didactic Planning Diamond (Bj�rndal & Lieberg 1978)); ethics in general for example classic ethical theories such as deontic utilitarian and virtue ethics; AI ethics - for example the guidelines drawn by the High-level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence at the European Commission (HLEG 2019); and the presence of AI in the real-world - for example a robot-dog used by the police being discarded after deployment due to its looks causing major public disapproval (Zaveri 2021). At the end of Phase 2 the framework user has to make a plan of learning activities that has to undergo a feasibility check (action d) during which it is assessed whether the planned activities are aligned with the ILOs and are compatible with administrative constraints (e.g. teacher time learner time rooms availability) and with other teaching activities in order to avoid non-productive repetition (e.g. accidentally teaching exactly the same content about algorithmic bias in exactly the same way in several IUs) and to cover blind spots (e.g. two teachers assuming that the other teacher covers data anonymization issues). While the current version of the GEDAI framework makes this planning action explicit further specifications of the framework can go into the details of what learning activities and teaching methods to use in order to achieve the integrated AI and EB ILOs or of what assessment tasks are the most suitable for these specific ILOs. In Phase 3 (Implementing activities) the framework user carries on teaching as in the case of any other IU with the mention that input V becomes relevant when the IU is an AI course in which ethics content is being integrated in contrast with input IV that becomes relevant when the IU is a dedicated ethics course within the AI discipline. Considering that the output of action c is a set of innovative integrated AI and EB ILOs the framework user has to be aware that innovative assessment tasks have to be formulated in action f to assess the achievement of these ILOs. For example a panel might be formed to construct a skill measurement approach that was targeted to AI and based on the ethical behaviour literature and practice and customized for the specific ILOs1. In Phase 4 (Refining instructional unit) the framework user performs the usual action of estimating ILOs acquisition by the learners (action g) through for example correlating grades with learners� feedback. Regardless of whether ethical skills acquisition was graded or not in Phase 3 in Phase 4 in addition to action g we propose performing an estimation of the impact of ethical training (action h) which usually also involves collecting 1. We thank one of the anonymous reviewers for this suggestion. 623 Vanh�e & Borit baseline data (Rhode Island Department of Education & the National Center for the Improvement of Educational Assessment 2013). This estimation intends to gauge the ethical growth of the learners and as such the efficiency of the educational activity in terms of growing ethical development. If the framework user has chosen to use the Ethical Expertise Model (Narvaez & Bock 2014) in action b to our knowledge there is no assessment tool that holistically addresses the four components of moral behaviour as described in Phase 1 above except a self-scoring instrument developed for dental education (Chambers 2011) and a questionnaire designed for veterinary students (Verrinder & Phillips 2014b). However tools exist for assessing all of the four individual components. These tools can be general or profession-specific. As examples of general ones we can mention the Defining Issues Test which is argued to be usable for assessing moral judgement abilities at group level (Rest & Narvaez 1994) for an overview of such instruments for assessing moral thinking see Goldsmith Burton Dueber Goldstein Sampson and Toland (2020) or the Professional Role Orientation Inventory (Bebeau Born & Ozar 1993) which has been used to measure moral motivation (Bebeau & Monson 2014). As examples of profession-specific tools we can mention the Dental Sensitivity Test which includes stimulus materials and scoring procedures to measure an individual�s ability to recognize the ethical issues often hidden within the dentist�s professional problems (Bebeau Rest & Yamoor 1985) or the Veterinary Defining Issues Test designed for veterinary education (Verrinder & Phillips 2014a). For examples of several other profession-specific tools see Bebeau and Monson (2014) You Maeda and Bebeau (2011) You and Bebeau (2012). The user of the GEDAI framework can explore how such profession-specific tools can be adapted for AI education. The strength of the GEDAI framework lies in the following. GEDAI focuses on teaching and learning ethical behaviour which can be more straightforwardly embedded in daily life than other ethics-related skills. This approach seeks to grow practical techno-ethical competent learners that is technically-able persons with the habit of using ethical skills when producing concrete technical contents (e.g. growing the habit of relating �training data� to �assessing bias� rather than jumping to counting the layers of the neural network). The GEDAI learners will be able of integrating ethics beyond just writing the optional ethics appendix after the implementation of a system and beyond fault-finding criticism with no pragmatic evaluation of solutions and alternatives. The GEDAI framework uses an integrative strategy to teaching ethics (i.e. teaching ethical skills explicitly within the core discipline and placing the same amount of emphasis on the development of these skills as on developing technical abilities) an approach which is considered to be more effective as it is more representative of the real-life application of skills in the workplace (Cottrell 2001). At the same time GEDAI makes explicit all the necessary steps to achieve this integration thus being more concrete or operational than other available solutions. The GEDAI framework provides high adaptability by relying on meso-level "containers" that can be filled in with specific content depending on the context (e.g. what are the hot topics of the moment). This feature ensures the longer-term effectiveness of the framework as it can adapt to the moving landscape of ethical issues and deontological rules. That being said possibly the strongest aspect of the GEDAI framework lies in its potential to facilitate the training of learners that have both technical know-how and the necessary ethical skills 624 Ethical By Designer to use this know-how in the "right" way; for example when engaging with the task of defining the system�s objective function the designer taught under the GEDAI framework will have the habit of remaining vigilant about direct indirect and unexpected involved stakeholders; the automatic routine of verifying that the system�s behavior derived from this function complies with all stakeholders; and the technical mastery of the mathematical arcanes for this compliance to be achieved by the system. However as in the case of any other pedagogical tool or model GEDAI only provides a foundation for organizing teaching and learning environments that maximize the chances for practical ethical expertise to be acquired but cannot guarantee that this expertise will be demonstrated on the field. We believe that giving our students the best chance to learn is of paramount importance when performing our activities as teachers. As a final note we have to mention that based on our own teaching experience and on numerous discussions with colleagues and learners we are aware of the challenges posed by including yet another layer in the complex fabric of what has to be taught to a specific set of learners. Multi-cultural awareness 21st Century skills (i.e. collaboration communication creativity and critical thinking) entrepreneurship or ethics all are considered essential for today�s learners. Contrary to the general feeling of some educators how to make space for all these in our teaching without having to remove extensive AI disciplinary learning is a skill that we have to grow ourselves as teachers. However this is not possible without the collaboration of the education leadership the administration the other teaching staff and of the learners themselves. The leadership has to prioritize teachers� growth time as educators over minimizing teaching costs as quality student-oriented teaching adapted to the needs of our times requires more time and resources than the usual frontal teaching. The administration has to be able to adapt to the needs of implementing this teaching (e.g. adapted physical rooms customized Learning Management Systems educational offers that adapt to the issues relevant in the society at a given time). The other teaching staff has to be open to have the same approach to their teaching as they have to their research. Thus making use of learning analytics (Ga�evi? Kovanovi? & Joksimovi? 2017) and latest research in pedagogy should be the norm not the exception. The learners have to see themselves as co-creators of value for themselves and for society from the moment they enter an educational program and not as dormant entities that will be activated after finishing a degree. 3. Who Can Use GEDAI Learning professional ethics is acknowledged to benefit learners and professionals (Bebeau & Monson 2008). Thus we envisage several user groups for the GEDAI framework: instructional units designers industry individual learners researchers and grant funders. Designers of instructional units (teachers course coordinators program directors) who want to create a unit from scratch or update an existing unit can use the framework as a complementary tool to any other tools that are out there for instructional design (see for example Branch & Kopcha 2014). Moreover they can use the framework to structure their critical reflection on choices to be made when integrating ethics in IU design and implementation. Action d will provide an overview of what skills are taught across units and avoid unproductive repetition or gaps. Growing ethical behaviour can be seen as a 625 Vanh�e & Borit transferable skill that can be taught across several IUs like for example collaboration or cross-cultural communication. Since GEDAI is explicit about what external resources to feed into learning activities (items I-VII) it contributes to aligning activities in AI education with developments that happen in the real-world thus aligning these activities with the needs of society and of learners. In terms of achieving the desired ethical behaviour the framework helps with suggesting operational ILOs for this domain. Consistent application of the framework will help learners move on the continuum of moral behaviour expertise. As further aid designers of IUs can build up on experiences of practitioners from other fields who have an integrative approach to training ethical behaviour (see for example Huff & Furchert 2014; Huff 2014). Industry stakeholders interested in improving the capabilities of their workforce and in fulfilling their corporate social responsibility can use the framework in a similar way as the IU designers. The GEDAI framework provides a structure that can be customized for the individual needs of the company (e.g. the needs of data analytics vs. robotics company). At the same time using the framework may reduce the transition costs towards ethical practices by allowing a smoother incremental uptake into practice of the AI ethics guidelines by their employees. An interesting effect of using the framework in such an industry setting is that since ethical behaviour is a transferable skill then other areas of the company activity might benefit from increased ethical practice due to the habits developed by the employees. However this transferability has to be considered with caution as it is highly dependant on the quality of the learning underlying the respective skill on the context in which the skill was learned and on the context in which it has to be transferred (Sasson & Dori 2012). Moreover according to Huff (2014) a distinction has to be made between general skills that support moral behaviour (e.g. self-regulation selfcontrol emotion regulation) and specialized skills that are applicable to particular domains and technical activities (e.g. listing common sources of visible discriminations made by neural network applications; identifying sources of hazard and develop appropriate fail safe procedures for a heavy robot operated in a confined environment) as the latter ones might be more difficult to employ in a different domain or activity. Learners both those learning by themselves and those enrolled in formal education can use the GEDAI framework as an awareness-raising tool. By examining the elements of the framework learners become aware of what is necessary to include in their self-growth process (e.g. various external resources) of the opportunity of learning ethics as a transferable skill together with learning the technical skills (much like learning statistics for example) and of the need to estimate own ethical growth (action h) and measure their progression in becoming a responsible professional. Funders of projects in education (e.g. the European Union) can use the framework for developing concrete funding programs and/or calls that promote the blending of ethics within operational skills rather than as yet another requirement that ends up being presented as an appendix while retaining the flexibility to incorporate what is relevant in the society at a certain point. The implementation of projects funded through such programs/calls would contribute to the growth of ethical behaviour skills in general and within the AI domain in a set-up that is more relevant to real-life and work-place situations. Researchers interested in curriculum assessment can use the GEDAI framework for specifying content analysis codes suited for exploring how ethics are integrated in the cur626 Ethical By Designer rent AI teaching practices or from a historical point of view. Those interested in the theoretical and methodological development of the field of teaching AI ethics can build upon the framework and possibly conceptualize/formalize it further. Researchers can use GEDAI for further framing the various contributions that can be made in teaching AI ethics (e.g. pairing activities and grading methods to ILOs). 4. Conclusions Integrating abstract ethical recommendations and technical implementations is not a trivial task. Embedding ethical behaviour at the core of teaching and learning AI courses can help and we propose drawing on expertise in computer science moral psychology and development and pedagogy to crack this hard nut. Being able to develop AI focused on social good now as well as in the future requires growing developers who behave ethically as a habit even in the absence of an explicit set of rules duties or imperatives. Climbers are safe when venturing up a rock by performing safety habits that they learned early in their training: double back their own harness buckle check the belay system or go through the starting commands. Likewise GEDAI-grown developers will be ethical when designing an AI system by performing ethics habits they learned early in their training: consider the misuse of the system by unintended stakeholders such as hackers; assess the impact of the optimisation algorithm on the well-being of it users; compare how alternative implementations of a neural network propagate discriminatory bias; or despite systemic pressure voice concerns of overlooking critical ethical concerns for cheaper software. Such a habit development in the GEDAI designers will have a long-ranging positive influence on the impact AI can have on society.

2018 SYED BORIT narrow lenses for capturing supporting information.pdf,  Supplementary Material 1  2 LDA Generative Process 3 The generative process that we assume the documents come from is described below: 4 1) For every topic k: 5 a. draw a distribution over the words (i.e. vocabulary V) ? ? ? Dir(?) 6 2) For every document d: 7 a. Draw a distribution over topics ?? ? Dir(?) (i.e. per-document topic proportion) 8 b. For each word w within document d: 9 i. Draw a topic assignment ???~Mult(??) (i.e. per-word topic assignment) 10 ii. Draw a word ???~Mult(????) 11  12 Each topic k is a multinomial distribution over the vocabulary and comes from a Dirichlet distribution 13 ? ? ? Dir(?). Additionally every document is represented as a distribution over the topics and comes 14 from a Dirichlet distribution ?? ? Dir(?). The Dirichlet parameter ? defines the smoothing of the words 15 within topics and ? the smoothing of the topics within documents. The joint distribution of all the 16 hidden variables ? ? (topics) ??(document topic proportions within D) ??(word topic assignments) and 17 observed variables ??(words in documents) is expressed by Equation 1. 18  19 ?(??  ?? ?? ??) = ??( ? ?=1 ??|?) ??( ? ?=1 ??|?)??( ? ?=1 ???|??)?(???|??? ???) (??. 1) 20  21 Equation 1 shows the statistical assumptions behind LDA�s generative process. The per-word topic 22 assignment ??? depends on the previously drawn (step 2.a.) per-document topic proportion ??. 23   Furthermore the drawn word ??? depends on the per-word topic assignment ??? (step 2.b.i) and all 24 the topics ? ?  (we retrieve the probability of ??? (row) from ??? (column) within the K x V topic matrix). 25 The per-word topic assignment the per-document topic distribution and the topics are the latent 26 variables and are not observed. We would have to condition on the only observed variable i.e. the 27 words within the documents to infer the hidden structure with statistical inference. This can be viewed 28 as a reversal of the generative process. The conditional probability also known as the posterior is 29 expressed by Equation 2. 30  31 ?(??  ?? ??| ??) = ?(??  ?? ?? ??) ?(??)  (??. 2) 32  33 Unfortunately the posterior is intractable to compute (Blei Ng & Jordan 2003) due to the 34 denominator. Computing the marginal probability ?(??) which is the sum of the joint distribution over 35 all instantiations of the hidden structure is exponentially large (Blei 2012). Although the posterior 36 cannot be computed exactly a close enough approximation to the true posterior can be achieved with 37 statistical posterior inference. Mainly two types of inference techniques can be discerned: sampling-38 based algorithms (e.g. (Newman Asuncion Smyth & Welling 2007; Porteous et al. 2008) and 39 variational-based algorithms (e.g. (Blei & Jordan 2006; Teh Newman Welling & Neaman 2006; Wang 40 Paisley & Blei 2011). Sampling-based algorithms sample from the posterior usually one variable at a 41 time while fixing the other variables. Repeating this process for several iterations causes the inference 42 process to converge whereby the sample values have the same distribution as if they came from the 43 true posterior. An example of a sampling-based algorithm is the Gibbs sampler (Griffiths & Steyvers 44 2004) a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. Variational-based algorithms create a family of 45 distributions that are closest (distance is measured with Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence) to the true 46   posterior. It is important to note that both variational- and sampling-based algorithms provide similarly 47 accurate results (Asuncion Welling Smyth & Teh 2012). 48  49 Coherence Measure Explained 50 CV uses four stages to arrive at an overall topic score: (1) segmentation of the topic�s top N words into 51 pairs; (2) probability calculations of individual words or pairs of words; (3) calculation of a confirmation 52 measure that captures the agreement of pairs; and finally (4) aggregation of individual confirmation 53 measures into an overall topic coherence score. 54  55 (1) The first step is to segment the data into word subsets to calculate the degree of support between 56 two subsets. CV segments each word in W with every other word in W where W is the set of a topic�s 57 top 10 words. This segmentation creates pairs S where the left subset is W�? W and the right subset is 58 W*? W. We formally define all pairs as ? = {(????)|?? = {??}; ?? ? ?;? ? = ?}. For example if 59 W = {salmon catch tag} then we can have the pair Si = (W� W*) as W� = {salmon} and W* = {salmon 60 catch tag}. 61  62 (2) The probabilities of single words ?(??) and the joint probability of two words ?(??  ??) can be 63 estimated using Boolean document calculation i.e. the number of documents in which wi or (wi wj) 64 occurs divided by the total number of documents. A Boolean document however ignores the 65 frequencies and distances of words. Cv incorporates a Boolean sliding window in which a new virtual 66 document is created for each window of size s = 110 (R�der Both & Hinneburg 2015) when sliding over 67 the document with one word token per step. For example a document d1 with w words results in the 68 virtual documents ?1 ? = {w1 � w110} and ?2 ? = {w2 � w111} etc. In contrast to a Boolean document a 69 Boolean sliding window tries to capture word token proximity to some degree. 70    71 (3) For every Si = (W� W*) we calculate a confirmation measure ? that calculates how strongly W* 72 supports W� and which is based on the similarity of W� and W* in relation to all the words in W. To 73 calculate this similarity W� and W* are represented as context vectors (Aletras & Stevenson 2013) as a 74 means to capture the semantic support for all the words in W. These vectors are denoted by ???(??) and 75 ???(??) and are created by pairing them to all words in W as exemplified in Equation 3: 76  77 ???(??) = { ? NPMI ???? ? (??  ??) ? } ?=1�|?| (??. 3) 78  79 Given our running example of W = {salmon catch tag} we demonstrate this using the pair Si = (W� W*) 80 as W� = {salmon} and W* = {salmon catch tag}. One of these context vectors is ???(??) = ???(??????) 81 now represented as ???salmon = {NPMI (salmon salmon)? NPMI (salmon catch)? NPMI (salmon tag)? }. 82  83 The coherence between the individual words ?? and ?? is calculated using normalized pointwise mutual 84 information (NPMI) as expressed in Equation 4. In contrast to pointwise mutual information (PMI) 85 NPMI shows a higher correlation with human topic ranking data (Bouma 2009). Additionally we use ? = 86 10-12 (Stevens Kegelmeyer Andrzejewski & Buttler 2012) to account for logarithms of zero and ? to 87 place more weight on higher NPMI values. 88  89 NPMI(??  ??) ? = (   log ?(??  ??) + ? ?(??) ? ?(??) ?log (?(??  ??) + ? )   ?  (??. 4) 90  91   Within a pair Si = (W� W*) we take all context vectors ???(??) denoted here as ???? and all the context 92 vectors ???(??) denoted here as ????? and calculate the cosine vector similarity ??? in order to obtain the 93 confirmation measure of the pair Si = (W� W*). The cosine vector similarity is expressed in Equation 5. 94  95 ???(???? ?????) = ? ?? ? |?| ?=1 ?? ??????2 ? ???????2  (??. 5) 96  97 (4) Finally the arithmetic mean of all confirmation measures is taken to obtain the overall coherence 98 score of a topic. 99  100 Calculating Topical Trends over Time 101 For every topic k = {1 � K} and for every year y = {1990 � 2016} we calculate the composite topic-year 102 proportion ????? as expressed in Equation 6. 103 ????? = ? ?????? ??  (??. 6) 104 ????? aggregates for every document d of year y the k th topic proportion ??? and divides it by the 105 number of documents for that year ?? to obtain averages. 106  107 References 108 Aletras N. & Stevenson M.

Following the development of reporting standards for models themselves empirical modelling has now developed to the point where these standards need to take equally effective account of data use (which previously has tended to be an afterthought to model description). It is particularly important that a standard should allow the reporting of the different uses to which data may be put (specification calibration and validation) but also that it should be compatible with the integration of different kinds of data (for example survey ethnographic and experimental) sometimes known as mixed methods research. The article motivates the need for standards generally and positions the distinctive contribution of the RAT-RS reporting standard. It describes how the standard was developed to ensure its usability presents and explains it and describes possibilities for future development. KEYWORDS Agent-based modelling; data; interdisciplinarity; reporting standards; reproducibility Motivation The scientific method relies on progressive research. In order to build on previous work we must both understand and (thus) trust it. Successful disciplines and methods do not only generate research but (in the process) establish standards by which research should be judged. In mature fields the latter process is often largely invisible. For example broad agreement about how regression analysis is done and evaluated is transmitted by the normal socialisation of new researchers rather than by debate. As a newer field Agent-Based Modelling must try to do research and establish standards in parallel. An Agent-Based Model hereafter ABM is a kind of computer simulation which explicitly represents �agents� � aspects of social systems with agency like individual decision makers or business organisations � in their interaction with each other and their environment. ABMs are indispensable in modelling complex systems: those in which relationships between individual and aggregate phenomena are not intuitive. For a more detailed discussion and example see Chattoe-Brown (2013). The present article is a contribution to the process of establishing standards in the area of data use for ABMs. Specifically we want to establish standards which allow for the use of different kinds of data (sometimes for different purposes) within the same ABM. For example (but see Chattoe-Brown 2019 for more detail) data can be used in specification (deciding what elements an ABM should have i. e. interviewing people about how they make decisions so we know whether this should be modelled as rational habitual or whatever) in CONTACT Peer-Olaf Siebers peer-olaf.siebers@nottingham.ac.uk School of Computer Science University of Nottingham UK INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY https://doi.org/10.1080/13645579.2022.2049511 � 2022 The Author(s).

This is particularly important since ABMs tend to focus on concrete phenomena (like unemployment or crime) rather than reproducing existing perspectives from distinct disciplines. This being so any effective standard needs to be interdisciplinary. The basic issue is very easily stated. As readers of Agent-Based Modelling research with many years of combined experience the authors have often found that they cannot reconstruct how (and almost more importantly why) reported ABMs have used data as they have. This means that it is hard to evaluate such research effectively (and fairly) that it would be difficult to replicate it (for example) and thus that it cannot really be trusted as a basis for further scientific progress (Stodden et al. 2016). What can practically be done about this problem? Previous research has already suggested an answer meeting with at least some academic approval. Devise a set of questions that researchers can relatively easily answer thus improving and standardising the reporting of data use in ABMs for their readers. Such a question set attempts to capture emerging best practice in a field support self-discipline in committed researchers and enable readers and reviewers better to evaluate research. However while the broad idea is straightforward successful implementation (producing an effective standard that might be widely used) is not. Such question sets cannot simply reflect the views of a single discipline or method but need to be genuinely mixed method and interdisciplinary. In particular the questions cannot assume � or even imply � for example that only quantitative data matters. They must be based on recognised expertise and active participation in empirical ABM research rather than being philosophical exercises. They must be as simple and well designed as possible to be compatible with the goals of ensuring that they are firstly adopted and can then be used successfully. This article thus proposes a question set constituting a reporting standard. Based on these questions researcher responses should adequately document data use associated with a specific ABM for understanding evaluation and replication. We have named this the RAT-RS (Rigour And Transparency � Reporting Standard). As well as simply describing the standard and emphasising a mixed method understanding of data the article shows how the RAT-RS should be used (based on an example) � and equally importantly why it should be used � and also explains how it was devised to maximise its value and usability. Apart from its general thoroughness practicability and generality attained by repeated testing and contrasting to other existing standards we see arguments from individual to community level for using the RAT-RS: ? support self-discipline for data reporting; ? structure the general thinking about data requirements; ? refine rationales for data use and create a shared procedural knowledge with the reader to enable better model assessments; ? facilitate establishing a common standard for data use to increase transparency and aid scientific progress in a maturing field. The article is structured as follows. The next section provides a framework for understanding issues of data use and integration (particularly across disciplines and research methods) in AgentBased Modelling. The third section describes other potentially relevant standards and shows how they justify the unique contribution of the RAT-RS. The fourth section explains how the RAT-RS was designed to achieve its goals. The fifth section describes practical issues in using the RAT-RS. The sixth section describes the RAT-RS itself and illustrates how it can be completed. The seventh section discusses testing the standard. The eighth section concludes and suggests further research and developments. 2 S. ACHTER ET AL. Challenges of data use and integration in Agent-Based Modelling An ABM like any other model resembles a phenomenon that we wish to investigate. Typically these phenomena are based on aspects we can observe in the real world. Data have the role of connecting the model and modelled world. In everyday language data is the result of a measurement activity. This covers a broad range from data measured through surveys to data measured through human sensory channels. Therefore data can be described as entities discernible from their context defined by the specifics of measurement (Boisot & Canals 2004; Floridi 2015). Such data become information only if they have meaning according to the widely recognised �General Definition of Information� (Floridi 2015). As justified above there is a need to clarify how data are used in ABMs and how they should be handled in modelling practice. As this themed section argues an ABM plays an enabling role in �relating and integrating different kinds of evidence and types of knowledge� which contributes to its increasing use in �inter- and transdisciplinary research as an integrating method� (see the Introduction of this themed section). However this flexibility creates a need for caution. Data themselves lack any meaning. Instead meaning is given by the researcher who uses the data and by the context of the ABM. Therefore their meaning might change when different data are combined integrated or used for different purposes than that for which they were originally collected. For example a survey validating one ABM might calibrate another. Under perfect transparency authors of an ABM would be able to convey each and every decision (and its underlying intentions) regarding how they progressed from their thoughts about the phenomena to the collection and use of data and ultimately to the final design and evaluation of their model. Although full transparency (in this sense) is probably impossible this issue nonetheless raises a severe challenge for Agent-Based Modelling as a research method. Other methods like experiments or grounded theory use more standardised procedures. Even though there are always ongoing debates about the right or best application of these methods there is a broad shared understanding regarding how their data are used to generate results. Therefore given the shared procedural knowledge of these methods researchers also share common understandings about the meaning of their data. This aim is more difficult to achieve for ABMs which are characterised by a much more creative design process depending on individual modelling strategies and a constant iteration between phenomenon data conceptual model and operational model. The model itself is the object of study (Weisberg 2007). However readers can only evaluate data use based on their knowledge of the published ABM and its description. This unfortunately often leaves questions unresolved about why data were used in certain ways. Thus (to avoid this) a better understanding of the model development process is necessary. This leaves us with two particular challenges regarding data documentation for ABMs. First the question of why data were used is not directly accessible through describing a model. Flexibility in the model development process also does not allow readers to derive such knowledge from shared understandings of standardised procedure. Hence there is a crucial scientific responsibility to report reasons for particular data uses. Second since the model development process generates a flood of decisions often implicit but still leading to subsequent steps a balance must be found regarding what to report. Maximal reporting is not a sensible solution and would probably not be adopted by modellers nor appreciated by their readers. In the following section we analyse existing standards dealing with data documentation. We demonstrate that the above mentioned challenges are barely met and therefore propose the RATRS as a solution. Review of existing standards In this section we justify the distinctive contribution of the RAT-RS against relevant Agent-Based Modelling standards. Two important criteria for a general standard are generality and use. These criteria exclude several proposed approaches. If we define use (rather generously) as one citation INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY 3 per year (including publication and present years) then we find the following (all citations in Web of Science as of 24.06.2020). Wolf et al. (2013) � Dahlem ABM Documentation Guidelines � has been cited six times and is only intended for use with economic models. Parker et al. (2008) � MR POTATOHEAD � has been cited twice and is only intended to document Land Use Cover Change models. While Altaweel et al. (2010) � Delineate Structure and Gather (DSG) � is meant to apply more generally it has only been cited five times. Siebers and Kl�gl (2017) � Engineering Agent Based Social Simulation (EABSS) � is also of general application but received three citations. Having excluded approaches that are not widely used (or are not general) we now consider how RAT-RS makes a contribution distinct from those approaches with clear scholarly impact. Interestingly the most widely cited standards predominantly describe models rather than chiefly documenting data use as the RAT-RS does. By far the best known is the ODD (Overview Design concepts and Details) protocol. Grimm et al. (2020) also references the original protocol two updates and a protocol variant adding decision making (with 2565 citations in total). In addition there is an ODD variant attending further to data (Reinhardt et al. 2018) but this is excluded here through insufficient citation. There is thus at least some reason to suppose that Agent-Based Modellers accept and are interested in reporting standards generally. The contribution of the RATRS can thus be characterised as documenting data use (and particularly its motivation) with as much detail and rigour as ODD documents models. However despite its huge success two issues with the ODD approach have motivated us to develop the RAT-RS independently. Firstly it has taken a long time for ODD researchers to see the need for data and motivation in later variants of the protocol. We are thus concerned that the way these are handled may be distorted by the preexisting protocol (which was designed without reference to data or motivation). We thus thought it useful to design a data standard directly from models using modellers to check that such path dependent distortion has not occurred. The second point is practical. Although the very latest version of the protocol discusses the value of rationale as part of an ODD this is not illustrated as feasible practice. (The supplementary material in Grimm et al. 2020 actually provides illustrations of the � perhaps unfeasibly onerous � TRACE Protocol and not a rationale extension of ODD.) We thus intend that RAT-RS provides a parsimonious rationale specifically for data use and not for the entire model or modelling process. Schmolke et al. (2010) � TRACE Protocol � has received 209 citations since publication but is intended for ecological models and thus fails the generality test that RAT-RS (through the way it was constructed � see Methodology and Testing sections) aspires to pass. In addition as with ODD its (intermittent) references to data mainly serve model description and take a particular view of both data (quantitative) and its appropriate role (calibration rather than specification for example � see Chattoe-Brown 2021). Lorscheid et al. (2012) � Design of Experiments (DOE) � is a general approach cited 90 times since publication. However despite the widespread perception that it contributes to data documentation the article uses �data� (perhaps unexpectedly) to mean almost exclusively simulated data and thus says nothing substantive about the model design process or validation (for example) which involves comparing empirical and simulated data. Monks et al. (2019) � STrengthening the Reporting of Empirical Simulation Studies (STRESS) � has been cited 23 times and is in a sense intended for general use. However it is designed to apply to Operations Research which arguably has different goals than social simulation (solving assigned problems rather than understanding social behaviours). This is shown by the fact that empirically tested description does not really fit the discussion of model aims and that validation is explicitly excluded from the guidelines. Finally we are concerned that the approach of synthesising existing guidelines (rather than at least partially testing documentation standards against real models as we did) may simply reproduce existing hazards for standard non-adoption (including implicit assumptions about data and the modelling process). 4 S. ACHTER ET AL. Richiardi et al. (2006) has been cited 96 times since publication. However despite an excellent synthesis of issues it arguably does not actually propose a documentation standard but suggests how one might be established procedurally. This proposed process nonetheless informed our thinking in designing the RAT-RS. Smajgl and Barreteau (2017) � Characterization and Parameterization (CAP) � has been cited six times since publication and makes a major investment in achieving effective generality (by applying its approach to 11 different case studies � an approach we also followed in designing the RAT-RS). It is also of unusual interest in contributing to the development of research design (i. e. systematic procedures for data use.) However the article has a particular emphasis � what it describes as translating data into model assumptions � meaning for example that it has little to say about data in the context of validation. It is hard to be sure but CAP may advocate model fitting � tuning parameters to ensure correspondence between real and simulated outputs � rather than independent validation. Despite its impressive contribution to modelling based on its own perspective we believe that it cannot therefore serve as a general basis for documenting data use in ABMs. The non-equivalence (despite popular perception) of fitting and validation is discussed in Chattoe-Brown (2019). Finally Laatabi et al. (2018) � ODD+2D for Decision and Data � has been cited six times since publication. The fact that it is intended to have general application and to build on the ODD protocol (which is evidently a successful standard in use) makes this look the closest to the proposed RAT-RS. Because this contribution is so recent it is not fair to expect it to be well cited already but it should be noted that nobody except the authors have yet published an application of it. We believe (and our research agenda for RAT-RS echoes this) that authors being able to apply their own standard is an insufficient guide to general usefulness (which may explain why so many proposed standards haven�t been widely adopted). Firstly a single example that Laatabi et al. analyse may be untypically suited to their approach therefore suffering selection bias. Further while they may explain the standard to their own satisfaction readers may not share their view that it is clear what to do or why it is worth doing it. Thus we believe that deliberate user testing must be a key part of any successful standard. Other concerns about the approach proposed by Laatabi et al. have also informed how we developed the RAT-RS both conceptually and practically. Firstly a standard is unlikely to be successful if it imposes a particular view of the modelling process and/or makes implicit assumptions about appropriate data. An important corollary of this is that the purpose of the RAT-RS is not to judge models from a single viewpoint � that others may not share � but to provide the information that allows it to be evaluated from a range of viewpoints. In a nutshell our intended contrast is thus not between good and bad ABMs but between ones that explain their data use adequately to a reader and those that don�t. The example that Laatabi et al. analyse makes almost no mention of qualitative data and links quantitative data arbitrarily to calibration (rather than for example model specification). It will thus be of little use to those doing interviews or laboratory experiments or those wishing to ground other model aspects in data. In particular Laatabi et al. neither make clear whether their ABM is validated (or how) or from a methodological perspective what research questions an ABM with calibration (but no validation) can answer. The RAT-RS is explicitly designed to handle all kinds of data different possible uses for data (specification calibration and validation) and different approaches to modelling methodology. (See the Methodology section for more discussion of how this was achieved.) Further while we are keen not merely to duplicate the aspects of ODD dealing with motivation and research design we find that many standards dealing with data suffer from �atomisation� which impedes understanding. For example Laatabi et al. provide a long list of variables and their possible states. But for the purposes of really engaging with their model the reader mainly needs to know that householders take multi-attribute decisions (this crucial specification assumption does not seem to be justified empirically) whether the set of attributes modelled is empirically derived (if it is) or arbitrary and how the actual proportions of dwellings with different attributes (and any empirically recorded correlations between these � we find no cheap houses that are very large for example) were given empirical values. It has thus been our aim in RAT-RS to strike a careful balance between asking �what� in regard to data and giving researchers the opportunity to provide sufficient �why� to support the reader�s understanding as well INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY 5 (whether in terms of design decisions methodology or practicalities as the case may be). Such an approach also makes the RAT-RS practically shorter since we have found that an ounce of rationale can save a pound of atomised description (which is potentially boring both to write and read). To sum up based on existing contributions our aim is an ABM reporting standard for data use meeting the following criteria: (1) It should be descriptive (not normative) and thus import no value judgements � whether explicitly or implicitly � about how modelling ought to be done (merely clarifying how it was done). (2) It should be explicitly designed for general use rather than applying to only one field or modelling approach. Nor should it originate from one field or approach but nonetheless claim generality. It should not encapsulate (even tacitly) views that prioritise one kind of data methodology (or ontology) or the perspective of one discipline. Its ease of use should not depend on the user sharing views with the designers. To this end it should initially be developed and tested independently and not as an adjunct to existing standards which may distort its design with implicit preconceptions. (3) It should only require a minimum level of investment and effort from users relative to the length of a typical journal article. For example the (incomplete) documentation shown by Altaweel et al. (2010) is only one page shorter than their article itself. (4) It should strike a sensible balance between motivating data use in ABMs and describing that data to avoid documentation that readers may find obscure and atomised. (5) Its specific focus on data documentation (rather than just seeing data as an adjunct to model documentation) would ideally make it complementary to successful protocols like ODD. We now explain how these objectives were realised through the procedures followed to develop the RAT-RS. Methodology The designers of RAT-RS (who are also the article authors) come from a wide range of disciplinary backgrounds and approaches to modelling (management natural resource governance sociology and computer science) thus ensuring that the RAT-RS was not captured by any one method or discipline. The initiative arose from a Lorentz Center workshop on Integrating Qualitative and Quantitative Evidence using Social Simulation (Leiden the Netherlands April 2019). At this workshop we came together as a multi-disciplinary group of junior and senior modellers. Besides regular meetings of the designers further steps in the RAT-RS development timeline were: Events at the Social Simulation Conference (Mainz Germany September 2019) the Second Workshop on Integrating Qualitative and Quantitative Evidence Using Social Simulation (Manchester UK November 2019) and the Third and Fifth Workshops in the same series (online June and November 2020). These workshops were all organised by the European Social Simulation Association Special Interest Group �Using Qualitative Data to Inform Behavioural Rules� http://cfpm.org/qual2rule/. We started by developing an initial RAT-RS version using our joint experience. Soon we became aware of the need for variants of the RAT-RS each considering a different driver for model development and after agreeing on a set of modelling approaches widely recognised in the literature we created what we call individual RAT-RS flavours based on our differing expertise. We presented one such flavour during a roundtable at Mainz (15 participants) and solicited feedback (testing activities which took place in parallel are discussed in the Testing subsection below). At this stage we also made the questions as brief and simple as possible. We also solicited feedback on presentations of progressively improved versions of the RAT-RS at the events in November (Manchester) and online in June (with a further 40 participants) and incorporated it into subsequent versions. To ensure that the formulated questions were reasonably applicable to subject areas targeted by the RAT-RS we tested 6 S. ACHTER ET AL. them independently with several articles some of our own and some selected from the literature. To avoid bias and arbitrariness we finally passed the RAT-RS to 20 colleagues for a final feedback round before writing this article at the online event in November. Two participants also tested the RAT-RS by completing the questions for their own models. Another reason for testing the RAT-RS with a collection of articles was the common critique that a significant number of existing standards are based only on a single example chosen by like-minded researchers. We then harmonised the RAT-RS flavours by eliminating overlaps (questions that were the same in all flavours). What we provide here is therefore the first completed version of the RAT-RS to support reporting on interdisciplinary ABMs. We plan regular revisions to the reporting standard via feedback from its use. Practicalities of using the RAT-RS Before describing the RAT-RS questions in detail this section presents guidance on its general use. Firstly it is intended to be as intellectually flexible as possible. Although we recommend its completion at least partially during modelling (so all important decisions are recorded) we expect it will also be effective in summing up data use after research is completed (as we have shown with our examples) and perhaps in structuring general thinking about data requirements early on. To this end the RAT-RS is also meant to be practically flexible. It is not necessary to complete it in strict order or complete all questions if they are not helpful. Instead it is intended to be a structure that modellers can return to in an iterative way. Nonetheless we recommend providing as much detail as possible and where the user is not sure how to respond that they follow their instinct and record their uncertainty in the �Any additional comments?� section (which should also be used where the RAT-RS appears not to offer space for information the user thinks relevant. Access to this data by the RAT-RS designers should also progressively improve the scheme both in specific questions and overall structure.) The �Any additional comments?� section can also be used to record developments during the modelling process that the user thinks remain relevant (for example empirical approaches that appeared promising but were ultimately unfruitful.) Thirdly the RAT-RS is designed not to interfere with other approaches like TRACE and ODD. Nonetheless we recommend it should be at least partially completed relatively early in the modelling process (and thus perhaps ahead of the bulk of TRACE recording and definitely before ODD which its designers recommend completing after modelling.) The RAT-RS The next subsection discusses terminology used in the RAT-RS. As this is an interdisciplinary reporting standard it is important to use a commonly acceptable vocabulary. Next we show the questions constituting the RAT-RS and illustrative answers from a real example. Lastly we describe the testing procedure we applied. Terminology Since the terminology of scientific modelling does not follow an overarching standard and is often contingent on communities and disciplines we provide a contextualisation of key terms used in the RAT-RS. In a scientific context a model is an abstract representation of the system scientists analyse. Whether this system is hypothetical or real-world although the latter is more common the modeller must make certain preparations among which describing a so-called target system is crucial. According to Weisberg (2007) target systems are described through a process of abstraction. In other words the modeller decides which aspects of the system under investigation are relevant for the ABM which itself depends on the phenomenon they are interested in investigating research goal(s) and model purpose. In an idealised process we might assume that a researcher would capture the target system they want to model by abstraction and then conceptualise it via model elements based on a formal modelling logic. INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY 7 Phenomena are �states or behaviours of a real-world system or group of systems� (Elliott-Graves 2020 p. 28) that are under scientific investigation. As such a phenomenon can be examined from different angles and by different disciplines. Social inequality for example can be examined from a political or economic perspective. In practice the underlying research process can be messy and it is usually characterised by an iteration between hypothetical/real-world phenomenon target system and model. If the conceptual model reaches a certain degree of maturity the iterations also include the operational model and increasingly shift focus towards later stages of the modelling process. Nevertheless specifying a target system makes particular sense under complexity where system elements and their interconnections are not self-evident and it is therefore difficult to identify exactly what produces the phenomenon. As Elliott-Graves (2020 p. 27) writes: �In fact the value of specifying target-systems often becomes apparent only when scientists run into difficulties�. The difference between the conceptual model and the target system is that the conceptual model is based on a pragmatic modelling perspective. This means that the tangible goal of creating a computable model is already manifested in the conceptual model which includes decisions about level of detail assumptions and simplifications (Robinson 2008). In other words the conceptual model is seen through modelling glasses while the target system is seen through more general glasses of scientific curiosity and the endeavour to understand and explain. Questions The RAT-RS consists of five question suites labelled model aim and context conceptualisation operationalisation experimentation and evaluation. Together these cover questions about data use for decision making specification calibration output analysis and validation within the full research life cycle of an ABM i. e. from defining study purpose to evaluating experimental outputs. To account for different approaches that often drive modelling we distinguish between theory driven Operation Research (OR) data driven model driven and participatory RAT-RS flavours. This distinction only proves relevant for the conceptualisation question suite (and indeed we tried to achieve as much question standardisation as possible) as this is the only place within the RAT-RS where the basis for developing the ABM impacts the kinds of questions that need to be answered. For the other four question suites there is no difference between the flavours and therefore only a single set of questions is needed. In the following discussion we give brief overviews of the purposes for individual question suites provide the questions themselves (which have explanations in braces where necessary) and show illustrative answers (in italics) for the model driven flavour. As stated in the Methodology section we tested the RAT-RS for multiple cases corresponding to the different flavours. In the response format for the questions we allowed a choice between two approaches (based on the tester�s preference): Responding to each question using plain text or responding to some questions with plain text and others using predefined tables. The full RAT-RS pack (user guide; questions suits for the different flavours; choice of test cases; set of templates) is available as a downloadable zip archive from https://www.comses.net/ codebases/f7e2c34a-4d07-4f37-9847-2b32df69528a/releases/1.0.0/. For the base RAT-RS pack (user guide and question suits only) see Appendix A. Question Suite 1 � Model Aim and Context Questions Here the questions focus on the purpose and type (main driver) of the ABM and help to define the target system. Possible type choices currently supported are theory driven models which originate from a pre-existing theory or theories OR data driven models which focus on OR problems model driven models which originate from a pre-existing model or models and participatory driven models which focus on the use of participatory processes to design models. We use the term theory as a collective term for theory theories or theoretical constructs (something with any theoretical elements and not only what is understood as mature theory). 8 S. ACHTER ET AL. (1) If this RAT-RS use is related to a specific publication please provide a reference to that publication. Chattoe-Brown Edmund (2014) �Using Agent Based Modelling to Integrate Data on Attitude Change� Sociological Research Online 19(1) article 16 February. doi:0.5153/sro.3315 (2) What is the purpose of the model? {prediction explanation description theoretical exploration illustration analogy social interaction or other (please specify); for an explanation of model purposes see Edmonds et al. (2019)} To show that data does not support a well-known model of attitude change (Zaller-Deffuant hereafter ZD) and that another model can be devised which is somewhat compatible with data. (Edmonds et al. 2019: Explanatory use.) (3) What domain does the model research? Opinion dynamics. (4) What (research) question(s) is the model addressing? {in general/in this publication} Is the ZD model compatible with validation data? Is there a �more realistic� model that is more compatible? (5) What is the MAIN driver for your initial model development step? {theory(s) empirical evidence existing model(s) participatory modelling data} A model (ZD). (6) Explain why this MAIN driver was chosen? Because of concerns about the empirical status of widely cited models (of which ZD is an example). (7) What is the target system that this model reproduces? {briefly describe the target system and its boundaries} Random mixing of agents with opinions (and uncertainties) and the effect that interaction has on both of these individual attributes leading to macro outcomes (such as opinion polarisation). There is assumed to be no environment (such as advertising billboards) and no other agent classes (such as media outlets). (8) Explain why this target system and these boundaries were chosen. Because the model is widely cited. In fact on reflection the boundaries are obviously wrong (it is implausible there are no media effects at all) but that is not the issue that the study tackles. Any additional comments? No. Question Suite 2 � Conceptualisation Questions: What and Why? Here the questions help to provide information about how data was used for defining the �What and Why?�. This refers to what aspects of the target system were considered for mapping into elements of the conceptual model and the empirical evidence supporting that decision. This question suite diverges for different RAT flavours because these aspects and evidence vary for distinct modelling approaches. (1) What previous model is used (or models are used) as driver in this model? Give reference(s) to the model/models. This (ZD) model has many variants but two were used here: Deffuant G. Amblard F. Weisbuch G. and Faure T. (2002) �How Can Extremism Prevail? A Study Based on the Relative Agreement Interaction Model� Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation 5(4)1 and Deffuant G. (2006) �Comparing Extremism Propagation Patterns in Continuous Opinion Models� Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation 9(3)8. (2) Why is/are this/these previous model(s) used? Example of a widely cited ABM with no empirical justification. (3) What are the elements of this/these previous model(s)? Agents opinions uncertainties random mixing of agents and opinion/uncertainty updating via interaction. (4) Describe how you moved from the previous model elements to the elements of your model. {distinguish (at least) between agents environment and relationships/interactions among any combination of these} Based on �social science common sense� and �the literature� added several social processes to see if the resulting model would validate better. INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY 9 (5) Explain why elements of the previous model were included excluded or changed in the current model. Uncertainty updating was too complicated for a model that did not fit the data anyway (so it was not implemented). The other elements were added to see if they improved validation. (Others could have been added or these could have been implemented differently however.) The aim was just �a� validation (which ZD did not achieve at all) and not an empirically definitive ABM at this stage. (6) Explain why a model element was added when this was not included in the target system. Since the aim of the study was to show that validation was feasible (even though ZD did not attempt it) the elements were added to make successful validation more likely. (7) If an element of the previous model was changed explain how it was done and why. Include sources if applicable. Added external media (the �stance� of the paper you read can shift your opinion towards that of the paper and stance change is exogenous) static (or dynamic) social networks (not random mixing) social interaction does not always lead to convergence but sometimes to divergence if opinions are very discrepant (the psychological literature is ambiguous about whether such repulsion effects exist � ZD assume they do not) multiple attitudes (rather than one) with movement towards (arbitrary) �ideologies� (patterns in opinions) to reflect cognitive consistency as a phenomenon. (8) Describe the procedures and methods used to conceptualise the key target system elements as model elements. How did you make use of the evidence? What other sources did you utilise to conceptualise model elements? �The literature� implies there is a media effect and the simplest process that could represent that was used (i. e. stances of papers changing exogenously). Where possible public data was used (i. e. how many people read a daily paper and how many close friends people have). The possible divergence of opinions was based on some laboratory experiments. Correlations in multiple opinions were based (very loosely) on survey data analysis as a general effect. Any additional comments? No. Question Suite 3 � Operationalisation Questions: How and Why? Here the questions help to provide information about the How and Why of the ABM. This refers to how researchers considered what they said they would consider in the previous question suite what data sources were used and what empirical evidence supports the decisions. (1) What data element(s) did you include for implementing each key model element in the model�s scope? �The literature� for media effects the roles of social networks and correlations in multiple opinions. Survey data for newspaper readership and number of friends. Laboratory experiments for possible opinion divergence. Some elements were not really data based such as the dynamics of newspaper �stances� (for example going from pro to anti government). (2) Are these data elements implemented with the help of qualitative or quantitative data or further models? Quantitative data was derived from surveys and experiments. It is not really clear what kind of data �the literature� is. No explicit qualitative data was used however. (3) Explain how data affected the way you implemented each model element and why. {i.e. explain your choice of data elements} Calibration where possible but mainly the simplest model that might validate (while ZD does not). (4) What are the data elements used for in the modelling process: specification calibration validation other? The distribution of opinions over time is validation (using British Social Attitude � BSA � data). All other data are used for calibration/specification. 10 S. ACHTER ET AL. (5) Why for this use and not another one? The article tries to follow full Agent-Based Modelling methodology of Gilbert and Troitzsch (2005) so needs at least some independent data for both calibration and validation. (6) Did required data exist? Yes except for the simplified social processes implemented i. e. what should the theory of the way that media change their positions on issues be? (7) If it existed did you use it? Yes as long as it was quick to find. (The point of the article was not to be right but to show with how little effort you can be better as regards empirical modelling). (8) If you did not use it why not? All data that could be found quickly were used. (9) For the existing data you used provide details (a description) about data sources sampling strategy sample size and collection period. For the data you collected provide details about how it was collected sampling strategy sample size and collection period. BSA survey (https://www.bsa.natcen.ac.uk). The questions used are given in the article. They were chosen to be controversial and to have good time series. It was reasoned that if attitudes on these matters do not polarise (which ZD seeks to explain) then none will. (10) Justify your data collection decisions from 3.9. The aim of the article justified these decisions. It was to show although ZD did not calibrate or validate their model that this was possible at quite low cost. Since the aim was not a true ABM but only one that was somewhat validated full data use was not necessary to the argument even if it had been possible (which in the case of how newspapers change policy for example I suspect it is currently not). (11) If you needed to analyse or transform/manipulate the data before including them in the model (regardless if you collected data yourself or you used existing data) what did you do and why did you choose this specific approach? Simulation outputs were flattened (somewhat arbitrarily) into pro neutral and anti-opinions to match the BSA data categories. (12) In what format was the data implemented? {e.g. look-up table; distribution} Validation data were percentages in the three categories over time. Calibration/specification data were just single numbers or social processes. (13) Why this way? Simplicity/compatibility. Can a simple and easily populated empirical ABM nonetheless demonstrate validation? If so how do we justify the continuing enthusiasm for non-empirical models? Any additional comments? The study also validated the changes in opinion category size (i. e. from 27% pro to 12% pro) over the length of the 10 year real/simulated run. Question Suite 4 � Experimentation Questions Here the questions help to provide information about calibration experimental design experimentation and output analysis. In addition they help to provide information about how the output was discussed with stakeholders (where applicable). (1) Describe the calibration process you followed stating which parameters you calibrated their ranges your reasons and the similarity you achieved. Number of close friends (but network structure was arbitrary). Percentage of people reading newspapers (but dynamics of media �stance� was arbitrary.) Replacing random mixing by networks was �common sense� relaxation of an arbitrary restrictive assumption. (There is no evidence that social interaction is random.) (2) Describe the experimental design process you followed stating your reasons and the methods you used for the different steps. {e.g. calculating warm up period run length and number of replications; sensitivity analysis; robustness analysis} Single runs reported INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY 11 but multiple runs eyeballed for generality. Run in is not needed because actual opinion distributions are used at actual times. Validation was only eyeballing because ZD clearly fitted data so badly by comparison. (3) What type(s) of experiments did you run? {e.g. calibration; empirical validation; sensitivity analysis; performance optimisation} Single runs. (4) For each experiment name the purpose (objective). To show that the augmented model (with less unrealistic assumptions) validated better (at least had turning points) as the data do. (5) Describe the parameters you used to set up the experiments? Different initial opinion distributions given what the topic was. Different numbers of processes (i. e. with and without media effects) to see what combinations could be validated. No systematic exploration of process/parameter space however (not required for the purpose of the study). (6) Describe the data output that the model was designed to produce your reasons for producing this output and the data type of the output (qualitative or quantitative). Opinion distributions over time for ready docking to easily available data. (7) Describe the (statistical) analysis that you used on the output data and why. None. Just eyeballing. Did not need more rigour to make the point. (8) Did you discuss the output with the stakeholders? What did you discuss? Why? What effect did it have on the model? N/A. Any additional comments? No. Question Suite 5 � Evaluation Questions Here the questions help to provide information about the validation process and how validation results were discussed with stakeholders (where applicable). (1) In validation what similarity measures did you use and why? What similarity did you get? What would you consider a good similarity and why? None. Just eyeballing. Did not need more rigour to make the point. (2) How do the data outputs support an answer to the research question? ZD outputs look nothing like the real data in fact. Outputs from the improved model do somewhat. Therefore validation is not an impossible goal requiring epic data analysis and should therefore be more strongly required in Agent-Based Modelling. (3) Did you discuss the validation results with the participants? What did you discuss? Why? What effect did it have on the conclusions? N/A. Any additional comments? No. Testing When evaluating the effectiveness of the RAT-RS we adopted the three qualitative criteria from Smajgl and Barreteau (2017): genericity and hence applicability across diverse cases; capacity to effectively structure the process of reporting data use and integration; capacity to lead modellers to report all details necessary to allow for understanding evaluation and replication. The standard was tested several times by the authors during the design process (see the Methodology section for more details). Independently from the authors the standard was further tested on two occasions. A subset of questions was tested with 15 volunteers at the Mainz roundtable. They each completed one flavour based on their own ABMs. A full version of the standard was then tested at the 5th Workshop on Integrating Qualitative and Quantitative Evidence Using Social Simulation. 12 S. ACHTER ET AL. The 17 modellers who tested the RAT-RS came from diverse communities (e. g. social science natural resource management economics health sciences) and were able to relate the questions to their own data use in building an ABM. This suggests that the standard is sufficiently generic. Regarding the second criterion we conclude that the standard captures all relevant steps in the process of data use and integration when building an ABM. As such no respondent ever indicated that the standard disregarded any use of data in Agent-Based Modelling as the method is actually practiced again suggesting that it is comprehensive and sufficiently generic. Regarding the third criterion discussion of the examples suggests that RATRS helps modellers to report all the necessary detail that allows readers to understand and evaluate data use decisions. Conclusion The aim of this article has been to develop and justify a reporting standard that supports the effective documentation of data use and integration in Agent-Based Modelling and present the socalled RAT-RS at a particular stage in its development (as part of the plan to promote its use). We have shown why such a standard is needed how we have designed it to be as easy to adopt and use as possible what it consists of and how to use it. Based on testing so far we have grounds for believing that using the RAT-RS will improve the rigour and transparency of data use in ABMs and thus improve the quality of research reviewing and replication. To facilitate its use we believe we have demonstrated that the standard is general intuitive and concise (the example in the Questions subsection was completed in 1200 words). But obviously at the end of the day it is users and not designers who must say whether something is usable or not. To this end a large element of further research on the standard will be user testing. We want to ensure that the standard really is as general and intuitive as we currently believe it to be (based on the development process described above). To this end we plan to design and implement a series of activities to promote user testing. These will include workshops where modellers complete and discuss their experience of the RAT-RS cooperation with existing institutions (where RAT-RS completion can be part of a summer school or training course on AgentBased Modelling) and ensuring that all the raw materials needed to complete the RAT-RS standard are adequately promoted freely available and well documented (and that the authors can continue to be contacted by potential and actual users.) We also recognise that adoption of innovations has a psychological element and that we may need to manage expectations convincingly (for example about how time consuming the RAT-RS is to complete) and use accessible dissemination strategies (like YouTube tutorials) as well as more traditional scholarly outlets. More generally this article goes about as far as it can based on the insight of the authors and informal respondents alone. While the RAT-RS can undoubtedly be improved (and will turn out to have limitations) the best way to deal with this is by promoting its use and responding to the issues that arise. This is also a tradition in the field of documentation standards where Grimm et al. regularly publish updates to the ODD protocol. Nonetheless there are areas where we can already envisage productive further development. The first of these is that while we are reasonably confident that the RAT-RS flavours cover the commonest approaches to modelling it may well be that new flavours or combinations will be needed based on user feedback. Secondly if the RAT-RS proves to be successful we suspect that an online version will facilitate both use of the reporting standard and the collation of data to drive further improvements. Thirdly we will investigate if and how RAT-RS can best be used with other documentation tools such as the ODD protocol. In methodological communities where procedural standards are either not achievable or not yet achieved other media for safeguarding transparency and rigor are needed. An open and ongoing discussion of such topics is therefore particularly needed and can be very fruitful. This includes appreciating and learning from previously failed and currently successful attempts as well as INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY 13 a continuous development and periodic reflection on and updating of established practices. We welcome colleagues who would like to join these discussions and testing activities. The RAT-RS is designed not just for reporting on data use but the process of completing it hopefully changes how people think about their use of data and its justification.

Peer-Olaf Siebers University of Nottingham UK Summary The Rigor and Transparency Reporting Standard (RAT-RS) is a tool to improve the documentation of data use in Agent-Based Modelling. Following the development of reporting standards for models themselves attention to empirical models has now reached a stage where these standards need to take equally effective account of data use (which until now has tended to be an afterthought to model description). It is particularly important that a standard should allow the reporting of the different uses to which data may be put (specification calibration and validation) but also that it should be compatible with the integration of different kinds of data (for example statistical qualitative ethnographic and experimental) sometimes known as mixed methods research. For the full details on the RAT-RS please refer to the related publication �RAT-RS: A Reporting Standard for Improving the Documentation of Data Use in Agent-Based Modelling� (Achter et al. under review). The following figure shows the RAT-RS question suites where the box names indicate the focus of a specific question suite. The RAT-RS comes in �flavours� with distinct Conceptualisation question suites (horizontal boxes). So the first step when aiming to use the RAT-RS is to identify the MAIN driver for the initial model development step. Possible choices currently supported by the RAT-RS are �theory-driven� models which focus on a pre-existing theory or theories �OR-data-driven� models which focus on key mechanisms �another-model-driven� models which focus on a pre-existing model or models and �participatory-driven� models which focus on the use of participatory processes to design models. 16 S. ACHTER ET AL. There are two different versions of the RAT-RS Pack the �Base Version� (which comes with all questions but excludes alternative formats and examples) and the �Full Version� (which includes the �Base Version� and alternative formats and examples). While the �Base Version� is supplementary material for our journal article (Achter et al. under review) the �Full Version� can be downloaded from the following resource: https://www.comses.net/codebases/ f7e2c34a-4d07-4f37-9847-2b32df69528a/releases/1.0.0/. Note that not all questions have to be answered. However you are encouraged to provide as much information as possible. Remember that this is a documentation tool. It is for capturing data use and its reasons in a non-judgemental way. If a question is unclear to you please answer it following your instinct and leave a remark in the �Any additional comments?� space of the related section. If you want to capture information about changes you made to the use of data over time (i.e. if you changed your mind while modelling) you can also provide this information together with some justification in the �Any additional comments?� space of the related section. Since the used terminology in scientific modelling does not follow an overarching standard and is often contingent on communities and disciplines we provide a contextualisation of key terms that are used in the RAT-RS. You can find our current �Glossary of Terms� at the end of this user guide. A final note. If you want to help us to develop this RAT-RS further please email us a copy of your filled in RAT-RS document(s) and share your experience with filling it in.

Glossary of Terms Term Definition Evidence Data Data can be described as entities discernible from their context defined by the specifics of measurement (Boisot & Canals 2004; Floridi 2015). Such data become information only if they have meaning according to the widely recognised �General Definition of Information� (Floridi 2015). Boisot M. & Canals A. (2004). �Data information and knowledge: have we got it right?� Journal of Evolutionary Economics 14(1) 43-67. Floridi (2015). �Semantic Conceptions of Information�.

(Continued) INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY 17 Term Definition Evidence Data element A data element is data corresponding to a model element. So for the disease example the data element for contact might be a survey (or diary) of social contacts while for disease progression it might be medical histories/records (and perhaps even laboratory data on how the disease �works�). Our own definition. Domain A distinct area of research interest independent of disciplines or applied methods. Our own definition. Driver Main starting point for the development of the agent-based model Our own definition. Empirical evidence Scientific evidence produced by empirical research methods. Our own definition. Model An abstract representation of reality (e.g. a phenomenon elements of the real world or a real world system of interacting elements) Partly from the ResearchGate answer to the question �A model is usually believed to be an abstract representation of reality. How abstract should a specification be to be considered a model?�. Examples are our own. Model element A model element is part of a model that may be somewhat self-contained and/or distinct in its operation. For example in a disease model you need both a model element for the contact process (who meets who and where) and another for the disease progression process (what happens once you are infected). One refers to an individual and their physiology and is thus somewhat distinct from the other which refers to interactions in the social world. Our own definition. Phenomenon Phenomena are states or behaviours of a real-world system or group of systems studied by a particular discipline such as population growth competition or predation.

Qualitative vs quantitative data Qualitative data is defined as non-numerical data such as text video photographs or audio recordings. Therefore quantitative data are defined as numerical such as closed survey responses or sensor data. https://www.simplypsychology.org/qualitativequantitative.html with our own additions.

While there is a number of frameworks and protocols in Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) that support the documentation of different aspects of a simulation study it is surprising to find only a small number dealing with the handling of data. Here we present the results of discussions we had on the topic at the Lorentz Center workshop on Integrating Qualitative and Quantitative Evidence using Social Simulation (8-12 April 2019 Leiden the Netherlands). We believe that important distinctions to be considered in the context of data use documentation are the differences of data use in relation to modeling approaches (theory driven etc.) and data documentation needs at the different stages in the modeling process (conceptualization specification calibration and validation). What we hope to achieve by presenting this paper at this conference with the help of the community is to move forward the development of a generally acceptable protocol for documenting data use in the ABM process. Keywords: Agent-Based Modeling Data Documentation Protocol Rigor Transparency. 1 Introduction A big problem in Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) is rigorous and transparent use of data [1]. Often a model is broadly explained but justification in terms of decisions about what data has been used how it has been used and why the modeler has decided to use it in this way is most often missing. This can be very frustrating making it difficult to understand and perhaps replicate the model. Looking at practices within the simulation domain there are some rigorous procedures in place [2 3] however mostly referring to specific fields stages of the modeling process or simulation paradigms. There is a number of frameworks and protocols in ABM that support the documentation of different aspects of a simulation study e.g. ODD (Overview Design concepts and Details) DOE (Design of Experiments) EABSS (Engineering Agent-Based Social Simulations). The ODD protocol aims to provide a standard format for describing individual-based and agent-based models [4]. Several additions to the original protocol 2 have been proposed in order to increase its functionality i.e. ODD+D (ODD + Decision) [5] ODD+2D (ODD + Decision + Data) [1] ODD+P (ODD + Provenance) [6]. The DOE framework focuses on increased transparency and effective communication through the systematic design of experiments [7]. The EABSS framework focuses on driving and documenting the model development process of mixed approach models [8]. However it is relevant to consider that some frameworks emphasize certain steps of a simulation study more strongly (e.g. output analysis) while others have a more holistic approach (e.g. general model description). Given the emphasis on promoting such standards in order to increase scientific rigor and transparency in ABM it is surprising to find only a small number dealing with the handling of data whether quantitative or qualitative in ABMs. The most notable effort is made by [1] by proposing an extension of the ODD protocol to improve the description of data-model connections. However our goal is to move forward with this discussion posing further questions: ? What can we learn from achievements regarding data documentation in other disciplines? That includes existing standards with the field of simulation research outside ABM but also from fields with similar challenges (e.g. the interdisciplinarity or diverse data types). ? Is there a need to distinguish a reporting protocol for different model approaches (data-driven vs. theory-driven vs. participatory)? ? What specific reporting requirements come with different stages in the modeling process (e.g. conceptualization specification calibration or validation)? The initiative presented here arose from a Lorentz Center workshop on Integrating Qualitative and Quantitative Evidence using Social Simulation (8-12 April 2019 Leiden the Netherlands). At this workshop we came together as a multi-disciplinary group of junior and senior modelers. Our aim was to create a framework for augmenting rigor and transparency (RAT) of data use in ABM when it comes to publication of these models. The RAT framework is still work in progress. What we present here is our strategy for developing this framework and some possible questions that we considered to include with corresponding fictive responses for demonstration purposes. What we hope to gain from presenting this extended abstract at the Social Simulation Conference 2019 is feedback on our initial work. We are aware that the creation process of an ABM is shaped by researchers� individual nuances. Hence feedback from looking back at one�s own research projects is of high value for us. Besides the presentation based on the extended abstract we are also participating in the poster session and organize a round table. Thus we are looking forward to meeting those of you who would like to contribute to developing the protocol with their feedback. 2 Methodology In order to develop the framework we used the following strategy. We looked at typical stages in the modeling process within which we identified issues regarding data requirements. We summarized those requirements in form of questions in a protocol format. We recognized that there can be fundamental differences in the model approach 3 that lead to different reporting issues for data used also within the different stages of the modeling process. Thus we distinguished two generic modeling approaches: (1) theory-driven; (2) data-driven. For evaluation purposes and to uncover gaps in our protocol during the development process we used the working example of a theory-driven model. The same procedure is pending for an example of a data-driven model. Lastly we also recognized modeling approaches such as mixed approaches (i.e. partly theorydriven partly data-driven) and participatory modeling not neatly fitting into one of the approaches hence probably representing a separate category we need to consider. Our goal was to develop a framework that is easy to use and to only include the information required for rigorous and transparent documentation i.e. to keep it as concise as possible in order to motivate people to use it. When working on it we asked ourselves two questions: "What should be in such a protocol when it comes to the use of data?" and "What is the data-related thing that is most frustrating when it is left out of an existing model documentation making it difficult to replicate/understand the model?". What we were aiming to avoid was creating a protocol that due to its complexity would be counterproductive. 3 RAT Framework 3.1 RAT Roadmap The RAT roadmap consist of several distinct steps to guide the modeling process. Currently they are labelled as START SPECIFICATION �DATARING� (i.e. the comprehensive consideration of the use of qualitative and quantitative data in an agentbased model) BUILDING MODEL PHYSICALLY and OUTPUT. In the START step we clarify the research question and make a decision regarding model type (theory driven data driven etc.). The decision about the latter will influence the specifics of the following steps. Assuming that we have a theory driven model in the SPECIFICATION step we will focus on mapping theory elements to model elements. The �DATARING� step provides a systematic account of relationship between model elements and data (which is why we have created a new term subsuming calibration validation and specification). In the BUILDING MODEL PHYSICALLY step we will use a subset of the ODD protocol (possibly with its extensions) to formally describe the model. Finally in the OUTPUT step we define the data that can be captured as output and which of these are used. 3.2 RAT Protocol With the RAT protocol we aim to document data use throughout the modeling process. We used the RAT roadmap to organize the protocol and followed a WHAT-WHY strategy to combine the process of reporting and justification. We distinguish between the use of qualitative and quantitative data and we encourage the modeler to say why things that would be available have not been used. Furthermore we encourage the modeler to 4 unveil hidden aspects of the model (e.g. we ask for all potential outputs of the model including unused ones) to support a "model reuse" culture. Let us assume we intend to model shopping behaviour using rational choice (which means that the modeling process is theory driven). In this case an example from the RAT protocol DATARING section would look like this (bullets represent the example):  Q3.1: What data categories have you considered to support each model element? a: What was data used for (specification calibration validation other)? b: Be explicit about data categories that were left out/modified and why. ? Gossip (who talks to whom about price); qualitative data > left out because it does not happen in our target population ? Search (shopping radius/search curve); quantitative data ? Budget ? Household income; quantitative data > calibration ? Disposable income; qualitative > calibration; quantitative > calibration > left out because unreliable ? Actual consumption; quantitative > validation Following on from this an example from the RAT protocol OUTPUT section would look like this:  Q5.1: Describe data output that the model can produce. Indicate if it is used in the article or not [Note: we assumed the RAT protocol would be filled in when publishing an article that describes the model] and if the output is of qualitative or quantitative nature. ? Quantities of goods purchased by households; used; quantitative ? Recognition of supermarkets; not used; quantitative ? How much money the agent currently has; not used; quantitative ? Satisfaction; used; qualitative 4 Conclusions In this study we have presented a prototype of the RAT framework. This captures the considerations that should go into the decision making during the modeling process. This framework intends to integrate available practices (e.g. ODD+2D ODD+P DOE) and fill in the gaps. As such the framework can help with conceptual model validation as one has to be explicit about aspects of modeling and could spot errors or lacunae when one finds oneself stuck in completing later steps. Moreover it could be used for communicating simulation models to those who are not experts in ABM. We would appreciate suggestions for items that should be included in the literature reviews �beta testers� and critical readers for the roadmap and protocol (from as many disciplines and modeling approaches as possible) reactions (whether positive or negative) to the initiative itself (including joining it!) and participation in the various activities we organize at the conference. 5 References 1.

Materials and Methods: Students participated in three sessions organised as FC implemented either as conventional FC or FC augmented with the GoDental! game. In the pre-class phase sessions 1 and 2 were organised as instructor-made video lectures plus a questionnaire. These activities were supplemented with the individual development of questions and answers for the game in session 3. In the in-class phase group and plenary discussions were used during sessions 1 and 2 and were replaced by game activities in session 3. Perceptions of session 3 compared to that of sessions 1 and 2 were explored via a questionnaire with both open-ended and Likert-scale items. Results: Most students (29 97%) perceived the FC session augmented with the GoDental! game as enjoyable. The game augmented session was perceived as more enjoyable compared to the conventional FC sessions. Students agreed that GBL augmented FC compared to conventional FC increased engagement (25 83%) motivation (24 83%) their integration in the social environment (23 77%) and concentration (22 73%) helped them learn more about the topic (24 80%) and was a good learning method (25 83%). There was a positive correlation between the degree of enjoyment and concentration and the feeling that the game helped them learn more about the topic. Conclusion: Game-based learning augmented FC proved to enhance students� experience resulting in increased enjoyment compared to the conventional FC setup. Future studies should explore whether the use of GBL in FC has the potential to increase examination performance.

BORIT and STanGVaLTaITE-MOUHaT 1? |?INTRODUC TION 1.1?|?Background and aim of the study The flipped classroom method has been widely used in higher education to foster student-centred learning.1 This method has also been broadly implemented in undergraduate dental education with relative success.2 Recent research in higher education indicates that the experience of the flipped classroom method can be enhanced by combining it with game-based learning techniques.3-5 The current study aims to investigate the use of game-based learning to enhance students� experience of the flipped classroom in undergraduate dental education referring to the first level of Kirkpatrick's evaluation model that is reaction to the new experience.67 The working hypothesis was that the use of games in the flipped classroom enriches students� experience. 1.2?|?Flipped classroom Flipped classroom (FC) is defined as a set of pedagogical approaches that (a) move most information-transmission teaching out of class (b) use class time for learning activities that are active and social and (c) require students to complete pre- and/or post-class activities to fully benefit from in-class work.8 As such FC is an instructional method that engages students in the learning process.9 It has been advocated that the FC method motivates students to learn and is more effective compared to only face-to-face or only online teaching.810 In dental education a recent scoping review concluded that FC improved students� satisfaction in the majority of the studies while its effect on academic scores particularly for skill development needed more research.2 Based on where they take place two types of activities can be distinguished in the FC model of teaching and learning: out-of-class and in-class. Based on chronological order the out-of-class activities can be further divided into pre- and post-class activities. Pre-class activities focus on concept exploration and meaning making. These activities can take a variety of forms from instructor-made video and audio lectures to printed/online readings quizzes and chats. This phase of FC allows self-regulated student learning. In-class activities focus on reflection discussion and argumentation. These activities can also take various forms from discussions to experiments and hands-on activities.11 1.3?|?Game-based learning Using games in education has the potential to enhance the players� engagement and thus increase their willingness to learn supporting the acquisition of knowledge.1213 The primary characteristic of game-based learning (GBL) is that learning materials are integrated into the gameplay to stimulate motivation and problem-solving skills in learners.14 Games used in GBL activities can be commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) (and modification of these) or serious games. The latter are games in which education (in its various forms) is the primary goal rather than entertainment.15 These can be built by learners and/or educators/developers. Games used in GBL can be computer games or non-computer games (ie analog games) with or without computer support. Based on the game mechanism the non-computer games can be further divided into six categories16: dice and luck outlay games thinking games quiz-/communication games role-play games and simulations and dexterity games. A recent rapid review regarding the impacts of serious games on healthcare and dental education17 concluded that serious games were engaging and improved learner satisfaction but stressed that these remain under-researched and under-utilised (only eight studies in dental education published between 1975 and 2016 were identified as using serious games). The limited research available indicates that while both traditional didactic methods and gaming have been successful in increasing student knowledge the use of games generally enhances student enjoyment and may improve long-term retention of information.18 Further research evaluating educational games among health professionals or those in postgraduate training concluded that games were not superior compared to traditional teaching methods in knowledge acquisition. However the level of reported enjoyment was higher in the GBL group.19 1.4?|?Games as part of the flipped classroom model Trying to draw on the advantages of both approaches educators have tried to embed GBL into the FC method. However only a few studies have explored this practice.5 Games can be used in any of the three parts of the FC: pre-class in-class or post-class.11 A recent scoping review of the use of GBL in FC indicated that the results presented in the articles included in their study were positive and supported the argument in favour of the efficiency of the combination of FC and GBL.5 In dental education the use of FC combined with GBL seems scarce with only two such practices identified by a recent scoping review.2 These two examples used quizzes as a pre-class self-evaluation tool to assess readiness for class120 with one of them using quizzes also as a post-class activity.20 This current study diversifies the use of FC and GBL in dental education by experimenting with a game setup that includes game activities covering both pre- and in-class phases of FC. The study assesses students� perception of the GBL enhanced FC session compared to the non-GBL (or conventional) FC sessions with particular focus on selfreported motivation of being in class engagement concentration/ focus feeling more integrated in the social environment of the class and improved learning. The game that was used that is GoDental! is described in Section 1.5. 1.5?|?GoDental! GoDental! is an adaptation for dental education of the serious game Go'n�Fish�Fishing for Knowledge developed at the ?? ? | ?765BORIT and STanGVaLTaITE-MOUHaT Norwegian College of Fisheries Science UiT The Arctic University of Norway.21 The Go'n�Fish�Fishing for Knowledge is a knowledge game that can be adapted to any kind of knowledge domain. For the purpose of this study the questions of the game were formulated from the knowledge domains of dental education. In order to increase the game's visual appeal to the dental education students a tooth was displayed in the middle of the game board instead of the water bubbles from the original design. In addition to fit the context of dental education the game's name was changed from Go'n�Fish to GoDental! The GoDental! game is played in three consecutive phases. In phase 1 (the "make questions" phase) an individual activity that takes place outside the class students formulate questions and answers from four knowledge domains indicated by the teacher for four categories of game questions. The teacher checks the questions and ensures that they are fit for purpose. Further the teacher supplements these knowledge questions formulated by students with practical and fun-still-serious questions for the fifth category of game questions. In phase 2 (the "answer questions" phase) students divided into small groups answer the questions in class based on throwing dice and moving pawns on a game board inspired by the popular game �Trivial Pursuit� (Figure 1). Players may bring with them any study material (eg books notes laptops) but they are not allowed to check this material during their turn to answer a question. The decision if the given answer is correct or not is taken by the player's group who can check the material to search for the right answer. When decisions cannot be reached through discussion within the group the players can ask the teacher for advice. This second phase is completed when one of the players reaches the tooth symbol in the middle of the game board. In the third phase (the "debriefing" phase) the teacher debriefs the game by reinforcing learning through discussion and reflection and avoiding false learning by providing the right answers to the questions used in phase 2. 2? |?MATERIAL S AND METHODS 2.1?|?Participants and knowledge topics The study was performed at UiT The Arctic University of Norway (Troms� Norway) in the spring semester of 2017. The sixth semester integrated Norwegian master programme students in dentistry (N = 35) and second semester Norwegian bachelor programme students in dental hygiene (N = 15) attended the same three teaching sessions as part of the teaching module in cariology. The first two sessions (sessions 1 and 2) were on the topics of de- and remineralisation of the dental hard tissues and histopathology of dental caries respectively. The third session (session 3) was on the topic of strategies for caries control in addition to a recap of the topics covered during the previous two sessions. The attendance was not obligatory and the number of students varied in each session. A summary of participants and knowledge topics can be found in Table 1. F I G U R E 1 ?

The students were not engaged in FC before. 2.2.1?|?Pre-class phase Conventional The first two out of three sessions (sessions 1 and 2) were run in a conventional FC setup. During the pre-class phase of these sessions three to four instructor-made video lectures (length: 3-18 minutes) were uploaded on Fronter the digital learning management system used by the university at that time together with a questionnaire that included up to 20 open-ended questions covering each knowledge topic that was discussed in the videos. Students were asked to watch the videos and answer the questionnaire individually. With game-based learning The third teaching session (session 3) was run in a GBL augmented FC setup. The students were informed that they would be playing a game during this session and that the game would start with them formulating questions and answers from the knowledge topics covered in the previous two sessions and the new topic covered in the videos and questionnaire available for the third session. Students were asked to prepare questions and answers from each of the knowledge topics and send them to the teacher with a submission deadline of 16 days. They were extrinsically motivated by a prize for sets of minimum 10 questions and answers. Six students submitted questions and answers all of them being sets of minimum 10 items. The teacher revised the questions and subsequently used them in the in-class phase together with a set of questions prepared by the teacher. 2.2.2?|?In-class phase Conventional During the in-class phase of the first two teaching sessions students were divided into small groups (the size depended on the total number of participants in the class and varied between three and six) to discuss the questionnaire questions (2-3 questions per group). After the discussion in small groups which on average took 15-30 minutes the questionnaire questions served as a basis for a plenary discussion where each group had to cover two or three given questions. The members of the other groups were invited to supplement the answers and express their opinions. The answers were subsequently clarified by the teacher. Towards the end of each session students were asked to fill in an anonymous paper-based feedback form where they could indicate three aspects each for what they liked and did not like during the session evaluate their overall enjoyment (on a 5-point Likert scale) and suggest how to improve the session. Each of the two sessions took two academic hours (ie 90 minutes in total). With game-based learning Students were asked to register for participation in the in-class phase of the third session in order for the teacher to know how many game sets had to be prepared. Students were extrinsically motivated to participate in this phase as they were offered free coffee/tea and pancakes in addition to the prizes for winning the game (one prize per player group). During the �answer questions� phase of GoDental! students were seated in the same room in a different building than the one used during the first two teaching and learning sessions included in this study. During this phase two teachers ensured that all players knew and understood the game rules enforced rules and supported engagement thus acting as game masters.22 A maximum of four students could play on one game board. The GoDental! objectives and rules were presented and subsequently the students began playing F I G U R E 2 ?

This phase of the game took 60 minutes. After a short break a 20-minute long �debriefing� phase began. At the end of this phase the students were asked to fill the paper-based feedback forms. In addition to the four questions asked in the previous two sessions students were asked to answer questions designed to explore their perceptions of the game in comparison with the previous two FC sessions. These questions were formulated based on previous studies on GBL (including research in dental education) that indicated that the use of games increased motivation engagement concentration feeling of integration in the social environment and learning in general (eg 1723-27). Thus the students were asked to think of the GBL and FC session in comparison with the conventional FC sessions and indicate on a 5-point Likert scale their agreement with the given statements: playing the game increased their motivation of being in class that day their engagement and concentration and helped them being more focused in class helped them feel more integrated in the social environment of the class and learn more about the knowledge topics. Furthermore students were encouraged to express their opinion if they agreed (on the same 5-point Likert scale) that playing this type of game was a good learning method for this kind of topic; that without having played the game they would not have learned so much about the knowledge topics; and if the students would like to play more games (similar with GoDental! but also different kinds of games). Students were also asked to give any comments if they wished so. 2.3?|?Analysis 2.3.1?|?Quantitative The answers of all students were transferred from feedback forms to an Excel file and analysed descriptively. Likelihood ratio and Kendall's Tau correlation tests in Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 26.0 (IBM SPSS) were used to compare students� enjoyment in the three sessions and correlation between given statements and the degree of enjoyment in session 3. The level of significance was set at P < .05. 2.3.2?|?Qualitative Students' responses to the qualitative questions included in the feedback forms were analysed through coding and development of thematic topics. Coding is the process of categorising and organising information into a meaningful framework.28 The term coding refers to the process of reading the data and dividing them into meaningful analytical units that are marked with a descriptive word or a category name. The coding activity was driven by the data29 which means that codes were created by the researcher while inspecting the data in contrast to for example using a pre-existing set of codes that had been developed a priori to the analysis. Codes were organised under thematic topics and representative quotes were extracted. 3? |?RESULTS 3.1?|?Quantitative Out of the total 50 students 26 dental and 12 dental hygiene students registered to participate in teaching session 3 that is the GBL augmented FC. Of these 30 (79%) students filled-in evaluation forms after teaching session 3. The highest number of filled-in evaluation forms was received after teaching session 1 conventional FC (Table 1). Most students (29 students; 97%) enjoyed the GBL augmented FC session (4 and 5 on a scale from 1 to 5). The GBL augmented FC session was statistically significantly more enjoyable than the conventional FC sessions 1 and 2 while there was no difference in the degree of enjoyment between conventional FC sessions 1 and 2 (Table 2). Most students agreed (4 and 5 on a scale from 1 to 5) that the GBL augmented FC session compared to conventional FC increased their motivation of being in class (24 students; 83%) engagement during the class (25 students; 83%) and concentration/ focus during the class (22 students; 73%) and helped to be more integrated socially in class (23 students; 77%) and in learning more about the topic (24 students; 80%) (Table 3).

BORIT and STanGVaLTaITE-MOUHaT (25 students; 83%) and stated that they would like to play more games similar to this one along with other different kinds of games during the semester (26 students; 90%) (Table 3). The enjoyment of session 3 had a positive correlation with concentration during the class the perception that the game helped them learn more and the agreement that the game was a good way to learn and they desired to play more games (Table 4). There was a strong positive correlation between the increased motivation of being in class and engagement concentration and the feeling that the game helped them learn more about the topic. Further the perception that the game helped them learn more about the topic correlated positively with the increased motivation of being in class increased concentration and enjoyment (Table 4). 3.2?|?Qualitative The qualitative results obtained from the feedback forms provided some insight into students� motivational perspectives in relation to the different activities included in the three FC sessions. For the first session organised as conventional FC three main �most liked� themes were identified (with equal importance): availability of videos the questionnaire and the teacher. The main �least liked� themes were (in descending order) as follows: difficulty of participation in discussions in plenary and the discussions went too fast. For the second teaching session organised as conventional FC three main �most liked� themes were identified (in descending order): small group discussions visualisations and the teacher (the last two were of equal importance). The main �least liked� themes were (in descending order) as follows: too much time for group discussions and too much repetition. After this session enthusiastic feedback was received when asked if they had any other comments: �I�m really happy about having access to videos and testing questions. Also to discuss our answers in groups� and �All cariology sessions should be organised in this way not only yours!� (this idea was repeated several times by different students). Several students also commented that the time for watching the videos should be included in the formal schedule of the module. During the third session organised as GBL augmented FC four main themes were identified within the responses to be the �most liked� question and two main themes for the �least liked� question. The main �most liked� themes were (in descending order) as follows: fun small group discussions that facilitated participation food and prizes and a lot of learning. The main �least liked� themes were (in descending order) as follows: lack of time for answering more questions and various complaints about the questions (too difficult too simple too similar). After this session enthusiastic feedback was received when asked if they had any other comments: �I love this teaching method!� �It was the best repetition session I ever had!� and �You can come to school unprepared and still learn a lot.� Statement/Degree of agreement 1 2 3 4 5 Playing the game increased my motivation of being in class today - 1 (3) 4 (14) 15 (52) 9 (31) Playing the game increased my engagement in class today - - 5 (17) 12 (40) 13 (43) Playing the game increased my concentration/ helped me being focused today 1 (3) - 7 (23) 12 (40) 10 (33) Playing the game helped me feeling more integrated in the social environment of the class - 1 (3) 6 (20) 14 (47) 9 (30) Playing the game helped me learn more about the topic 1 (3) - 5 (17) 11 (37) 13 (43) Playing this kind of game is a good learning method for this kind of topic - 2 (7) 3 (10) 6 (20) 19 (63) Without having played the game I would have not learned so much about the topic 2 (7) 3 (10) 16 (55) 4 (14) 4 (14) I would like to play more games during the semester - 1 (3) 2 (7) 8 (28) 18 (62) Note: The total number of answers is different for each statement due to missing data.

BORIT and STanGVaLTaITE-MOUHaT 4? |?DISCUSSION Dental education worldwide is increasingly including many student active teaching methods with FC being only one of them. With other disciplines trying to enhance students� experience of this teaching method by including GBL elements (eg software engineering30 data science4 English language3) this study explored this approach in a dental education context with the working hypothesis that GBL enriches student experience in FC. In this study there were statistically significantly more students who rated their enjoyment higher after the GBL augmented FC session compared to conventional FC sessions (P < .001). These results confirm our working hypothesis and are in line with previous studies about using GBL in FC where higher ratings for satisfaction with the GBL augmented FC were statistically significant in the group involved in a FC with GBL compared to the group involved in conventional FC learning (P < .001).3 In this study four out of five students reported that GBL augmented FC session compared to the conventional FC sessions increased their motivation of being in class and their engagement during the class. The motivation of being in class positively correlated with increased engagement concentration and the perception that playing the game helped them learn more while engagement during the class positively correlated with increased concentration and the desire to play more games during the semester. Participation in a class activity even if passive seems to increase learning outcomes and benefits especially for the students with lower academic performance.31 As one of the participants in our study explained in the context of GBL augmented FC �you can come to school unprepared and still learn a lot.� This statement also raises the pertinent issue of student preparedness during pre-class phase and utilisation of online resources. However it is not possible to control for student preclass preparedness as attending lectures (which might have been considered by the students to correspond to the pre-class phase in FC) is not mandatory in this programme while attending seminars (which might have been considered by the students to correspond to the in-class phase in FC) is obligatory. In this study four out of five students reported that playing the game helped them learn more about the topic and this correlated to increased concentration and enjoyment. This perception might have been facilitated by the GoDental! rules which reinforced the achievement of the intended learning outcomes through repetition of knowledge material and reflection over it (preparing questions and answers answering the questions judging answers to questions during debriefing) and through discussions (judging answers to questions during debriefing). GoDental! is a quiz/communication type of game16 and such type of games have been used previously in the context of GBL augmented FC.4 However the GoDental! rules make the game go beyond addressing simple recollection of knowledge as they encourage reflection and thorough group discussion. As one of the students reported during the GBL augmented FC session �when we play everybody needs to participate�no one can hide.� In addition GoDental! provided several opportunities to recap the topics in different settings (individually in small groups in plenary). Working in small groups was liked in both sessions 2 and 3 but the responses from session 3 provided more insight into why this was the case. It seems that the GoDental! play mechanics (a) �forced� all players (ie students) to participate not allowing anybody to �hide�; (b) facilitated discussion flow; (c) facilitated co-creation of knowledge as players had to explain their answers to the group and the group had to explain the �correct/wrong� verdict to the player (as one student formulated �[I liked] the collaboration in completing each other's answers�). In total 90% of the students expressed that they would like to play more games during the semester. In this study 73% of the students reported that the GBL augmented FC increased their concentration in class or helped them focus more. Increased concentration in class positively correlated with learning more about the topic the desire to play more games during the semester and enjoyment of the session. These results are in line with previous studies about using GBL in FC where higher ratings for attention during a GBL augmented FC were statistically significant in the group playing the game (P < .001).3 Even though the feedback form was constructed based on the previous research on the use of games in higher education the form was not validated. However there was a statistically significant correlation between the negative control question (without having played the game I would have not learned so much about the topic) and the positive question (playing the game helped me learn more about the topic) in addition to similar correlations between these two questions with the questions about increased motivation and engagement. Thus it is reasonable to believe that the instrument measured what was intended to be measured at a satisfactory degree. Moreover students were asked to evaluate session 3 as a whole session (ie both pre- and in-class phases). However it was not possible to measure how much of an emphasis the students placed on each of these phases when filling the feedback forms. Considering that the pre-class phase was implemented almost in the same manner (videos and questionnaire and only six students formulated game questions and answers in this phase) it might be possible that students referred in their feedback only to the in-class phase of the third session (ie the �answer questions� and �debriefing� phases of the GoDental! game). Nevertheless the main �most liked� aspects of session 1 videos and questionnaires were not mentioned in the feedback form filled in after session 3. This might be because either answering questions in a game setting really took precedence or the students filled the form considering only the in-class phase of session 3 and not the entire session. Feedback questions in future studies could be more explicit about these aspects and remind the students that the third questionnaire does not refer to only the inclass phase of the game augmented FC. Furthermore the participation in any of the three teaching and learning sessions was not mandatory and out of 50 registered students in the module 44 and 28 students filled the feedback forms after attending the in-class phase of sessions 1 and 2 respectively. In addition the number of participants in those in-class phases was not recorded and it was not mandatory to fill the feedback forms. For session 3 38 students registered to participate in the in-class phase ?? ? | ?771BORIT and STanGVaLTaITE-MOUHaT but only 30 students filled the feedback forms. Moreover some students who registered did not participate and some joined the session without registering. It is possible that the students who filled the feedback forms in session 3 actually did not participate in any of the previous two sessions. Therefore selection bias might have been introduced. Further connecting individual students� feedback from all three sessions could allow analysis on the individual level which may provide a deeper insight into the students� perception of GBL augmented FC compared to the conventional FC sessions. However the setup of feedback collection in this study does not allow for following an individual student through the three sessions. Moreover it was not possible to identify if the response was of a dental or a dental hygiene student assuming that differences in students� backgrounds may affect their perception. During session 3 one student who submitted 10 questions in the pre-class phase and the winners of each player group in the in-class phase were rewarded with prizes. In addition in the inclass phase students were offered coffee/tea and pancakes. No incentives were offered during sessions 1 and 2 (ie conventional FC). Rewards might have increased enjoyment and satisfaction and thus they could have influenced students� perception of session 3.32 Simultaneously rewards could have distracted students from the learning objectives.33 However the perception of the participants in our study was that compared to conventional FC playing the game helped them learn more about the topic. It correlated to the increased motivation of being in class increased concentration and enjoyment thus indicating that the rewards were not perceived as distracting. Further studies could confirm this self-reported increased learning through an evaluation of examination performance that is other levels of Kirkpatrick's evaluation model namely learning and results. Even though the evidence from research shows that the FC approach is overall well perceived by teachers and learners the objective learning outcomes of using this method are not widely investigated.3435 A recent study comparing two cohorts of students exposed to conventional and FC teaching concluded that FC approach in undergraduate dental education improved immediate but not the end of the course evaluation.1 Our study compared GBL augmented FC with conventional FC but only the self-reported reaction to experience of the students was evaluated and no measurement of learning and results such as objective learning and examination performance was included. Several students commented in the feedback forms filled after sessions 1 and 2 that the time for watching the videos should have been included in the formal schedule of the module. This might indicate the perceptions of increased workload in an FC setup as reported in previous studies.36 5? |?CONCLUSION Embedding GBL activities within the FC method proved to improve students� enjoyment in the context of our study. Compared to a conventional FC setup the GBL enhanced implementation of FC seemed to have provided more opportunities for engagement in class motivation of being in class and helped students learn more about the topics (all these are self-reported perceptions). These perceived benefits of GBL are in line with previous studies on the effectiveness of GBL in higher education. Based on the results of this study it can be suggested to include GBL activities in FC especially in the in-class phase in order to augment the potential of this student active method for improved educational experience of the students. Further studies should explore whether the use of GBL in FC has the potential to increase examination performance.

Construction Research Congress 2332�2339.   8 Appendix B. In-depth description of six Research Design Types Research design type 1 (Game ? ABM) is characterised by a sequence that moves from the game to the ABM. The game is leading the process even though the sequence might be repeated over multiple iterations to include multiple data sources and is used as a facilitation tool to collect discuss and integrate stakeholder knowledge into an overarching model concept. The ABM is constructed after the game reflecting the components scheduling processes and flow of the game. Subsequently both components represent the same target system. Type 1 research designs are most commonly found in research projects with stakeholder involvement at their core. The game is then used as a vehicle to develop a concept model in a participatory fashion. We found nine publications using this research design all of which apply RPGs as a participatory approach in the field of natural resource management. Six of these articles label their approach as companion modelling (A1#17 ( = Table A1 row #17) A1#25 A1#33 A1#39 A1#40 A1#50) and three refrain from self-description (A1#1 A1#12 A1#48). The sequence of research design type 2 (Game ? ABM) begins with either creating a game or using an existing game. Similar to type 1 (Game ? ABM) the ABM is developed or employed after the game. However in type 2 research design the ABM depicts a different target system (section 2.2.). The ABM is constructed with the goal to improve the game performance or to simulate the game itself. It is a relatively rare occurrence in our dataset (three articles) applied to explore player decision making (A1#45) the effects of the game settings on player attitudes changes (A1#15) or introducing group management with the purpose of enhancing the performance of a serious game in achieving learning goals (A1#18). In all these studies the system 9 simulated in ABM is either a part of the system defined for the game or a different target system. In research design type 3 (ABM ? Game) the sequence transitions from the ABM to the game. A research project initiates with a (simple) ABM of the investigated phenomenon. The game is constructed either to mirror the ABM or highlight its specific aspects. Both the ABM and the game explore the same target system and employ identical or vastly similar mechanics. Type 3 research designs are found in communitybased approaches aiming at engaging stakeholders and improving communication among different interest groups. Five out of eight papers representing type 3 explore natural resource management by using analogue RPGs to engage stakeholders in validating (A1#5 A1#7 A1#10 A1#42 ) or calibrating (A1#22) the ABM. Additional two articles are related to urban logistics and employ RPGs to validate and improve model ontology and dynamics (A1#3) or to test the predictive ability of the ABM (A1#27). The last publication of type 3 refers to ethics and trust and exercises the game for ABM verification and validation purposes (A1#28). Research design type 4 (ABM ? Game) starts with the creation of an ABM and the subsequent game that aims to collect additional knowledge to feed back in the ABM. Although observations from the gaming session are applied to enhance the initial ABM the game itself is a stand-alone product representing a distinct target system. Type 4 designs are mainly employed in studies investigating human interactions in social or socio-technical systems. While the purpose of the game can be similar to the one in type 3 designs (i.e. validating an ABM) the approach here offers opportunities to extend prevailing models with new dynamics or triangulate by linking results. The type 4 approach employs games in experimental settings with the goal to extend or tune existing ABMs. Four out of nine type 4 publications focus on natural resource 10 management and use digital RPGs to collect data on player behaviours (A1#36 A1#41 A1#49). In all of these studies subjects interact directly with a computer via a user interface in an experimental setting. The digital RPGs were used in a similar fashion to the analogue games described in type 3. They are used as a data collection set up to test different intervention scenarios with the players in an experimental setup (A1#19) to evaluate and calibrate ABMs through controlled laboratory experiment with an online game platform (A1#30 A1#37) and anagram games (A1#11) and to extend agents capacities of agents to make them more �human-like� (A1#8). One example (A1#47) uses behavioural economics games in a mix of methods e.g. desk research and interviews to calibrate simulations. Research design Type 5 (Game + ABM) showcases studies where the ABM is an inherent element of the game and is therefore created as a part of game development. During a gaming session the ABM simulates complex mechanics (e.g. dynamic effects on an environment resulting from player interactions). Depending on what simulated effects are needed to support the gameplay the target systems may be equivalent or different. Similar to types 1 and 3 type 5 research designs in our sample study use community-based approaches. Five of the six studies are on the natural resource management domain and combine an ABM with an RPG. In these studies ABM is used to calculate and represent the impacts of player actions on an ecological system (water management (A1#2 A1#13 A1#43); biodiversity (A1#38); or land management (A1#16)). One study uses the ABM to supplement a city logistics game by visualizing an additional layer of information (A1#51). Research designs Type 6 (ABM = Game) describes projects in which an ABM is built as a game either by creating a brand new application or transforming an existing ABM into a game. Since the ABM and the Game have one application they represent 11 one target system. Their components are intertwined and comprise the application�s mechanics rules and user interface(s). Type 6 research design is increasingly popular (17 examples in this review - between 2017 and 2018 type 6 represented more than 50% of analysed publications) and relatively diverse. They are present in community-based approaches and studies that research human behaviour explore socio-technological systems or experiment with business games. More recently ABM=games (or agentbased simulation games) have been the most common research design to support policy development. The first type 6 study (in our sample study) was used to describe emissions trading (A1#32). Later it has been applied in a variety of fields e.g. public health (A1#14 A1#24 A1#31) construction management (A1#52) security (A1#44) group dynamics (A1#29) or businesses games (A1#23 A1#46). Moreover type 6 design has been used in studies engaging stakeholders e.g. in natural resource and risks management (A1#4 A1#6 A1#9 A1#20 A1#21 A1#26) air traffic management (A1#34) and humanitarian logistics (A1#35) In addition there are few research setups that include multiple design types in one study. For example a study initially designed in a type 1 or type 3 research design sequence can transition to a type 5 at a later stage if additional resources are available (e.g. A1#13).  12 Appendix C.

Games offer engaging environments generating insights into social dynamics perceptions and behaviours while agent-based models support the analysis of complexity. Games and agent-based models share the important ability both to input and output qualitative and quantitative data. Currently there is no overview of GAM approaches. In a systematic literature review we identified six research design types in empirical studies to date. The functional range of these design types is wide with diverse application domains involving analogue digital and hybrid games. This makes GAM a highly versatile approach appealing to researchers in both natural and social sciences along with the gaming community itself. To consolidate the GAM field we propose recording the design and implementation of studies that combine games and agent-based models by using a dedicated documentation scheme. KEYWORDS Agent-based modelling; games; game design; research design; systematic literature review 1 Introduction The gaming sector has grown to enormous size. With estimates of about 2.4 billion active gamers worldwide (Clement 2021) approximately one-third of the human population is playing regularly. The potential of games to create engaging environments where people interact explore and take on collective challenges is well known (Ampatzidou & Gugerell 2019). �Computerassisted gaming has moved into social studies urban and land-use management ecology education international relations healthcare and natural resources� (Klabbers 2006) often to support public participation or to communicate research findings to wider audiences (Pfirman et al. 2021). In recent years we have observed the rising popularity of research applications combining games and approaches used to explore social complexity such as agent-based models (ABMs). Today we find manifestations of these combinations in hybrid composite simulation (Le Page et al. 2014) agent-based participatory simulation (Guyot & Honiden 2006) or experimental setups CONTACT Timo Szczepanska timo.szczepanska@uit.no Norwegian College of Fishery Science UiT the Arctic University of Norway UiT The Arctic University of Norway PO Box 6050 Langnes N-9037 Troms� Norway Supplemental data for this article can be accessed here INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY https://doi.org/10.1080/13645579.2022.2050119 � 2022 The Author(s).

(Ren et al. 2018). However the consolidation of the emerging field combining games and agentbased models which we propose to call GAM is hindered by the absence of methodological advice about how and when to use this combination slowing down its uptake replicability and systematisation. First-time practitioners are particularly affected by this issue because they cannot rely on intuitions and tacit knowledge available to their more experienced colleagues who often pioneered the field. This lack of systematic methodological description leads to local innovations and reinvention of research designs. This article aims to lay a methodological foundation for GAM by developing a structured overview and analysis of existing practices (how and when the GAM has been used) and by proposing a documentation scheme to maintain consolidation. This can serve as a first basis for future methodological debates. In particular the study a) identifies general patterns in GAM papers (e.g. frequency of publication over time application domain publication outlet authorship) b) synthesises existing research design types used to combine game and ABM applications c) describes application areas of such design types (over time purpose field and collaboration practices) and d) proposes a structure to document research studies using GAM. In order to make the GAM methodology explicit we characterised each research design type by four features: (1) sequencing of research elements (2) correspondence between elements (3) relationship with the real-world phenomenon under investigation (target system) and (4) purpose of combining the two elements. Thus this article will inform and inspire both novices and experienced researchers in choosing context-appropriate designs for applied research and improving current practice. The study targets practitioners in gaming and social simulation communities by providing evidence insight and guidance on how to combine the two approaches effectively. Consequently results presented here are also of value to practitioners interested in integrating qualitative and quantitative evidence (which is a strength of both games and ABM). While the study reviews research applications combinations of games and ABM can also be used for other purposes mainly learn-based interventions to trigger and facilitate change (e.g. Rodela et al. 2019). This paper continues with a description of games and ABMs highlighting the benefits of combining them. Subsequently we outline the criteria developed to describe the diverse research designs implemented in past empirical studies. Methodology and limitations of our review are reported in Section 3 followed by the results in Section 4 focusing on the research design types identified. Recommendations for using and reporting the GAM approach are then presented in Section 5. The article closes with a summary and suggestions for future development. 2 Conceptual background 2.1 Games and ABMs Defining what a game is in general terms is not an easy task. Various attempts highlight specific characteristics of games. Some authors point out that a game is fun or at least entertaining (Caillois 2001) while others define it as a system in which players engage in an artificial conflict (Salen & Zimmerman 2003). In this study we follow an inclusive definition of games formulated by game designer McGonigal (2011 p. 21) offering analytical advantages: �When you strip away the genre differences and the technological complexities all games share four defining traits: a goal rules a feedback system and voluntary participation.� Some unique traits of games are particularly interesting for researchers. For example games can provide an imaginary setting in which players take on particular roles in a defined situation (Barreteau 2003). The imaginary settings of games allow players to explore cooperate or compete without experiencing real-life consequences. The act of playing a game can be interpreted as a mode of communication in which players use a rule-based language to transmit and receive messages (Duke 1974). In science games have been used to support social learning communication 2 T. SZCZEPANSKA ET AL. collective decision-making and increase the overall engagement of stakeholders in participatory approaches (Bakhanova et al. 2020). Additionally games are used as data collection tools successfully engaging volunteers in citizen science projects (e.g. www.fold.it). ABMs are abstract representations of complex systems depicted from the perspective of their components and inter-relationships instantiated as computer programmes. In an ABM heterogeneous agents characterised by multiple attributes interact with one another and the environment based on a defined set of formal rules (Miller & Page 2009). By analysing the outputs of the programme emergent macro-level phenomena can be rigorously related to the individual characteristics and behaviours of the implemented software agents. Importantly agent-based modelling allows researchers to systematically explore counterfactual scenarios in an in silico environment. In combining a game with an ABM in a single research application (i.e. using a GAM approach) researchers can benefit from both their individual strengths and the synergy between them. This potential was initially employed in the field of natural resource management. The idea of combining games with ABMs was first described by Barreteau (1998) and Bousquet et al. (1999) to support integrated management approaches. Barreteau et al. (2002) pointed out that there is a striking correspondence between the features of an ABM and those of a game: agents and players model rules and game rules model time steps and game turns simulation runs and game sessions a model interface and a gameworld and so on. In a GAM setting the ABM offers opportunities to (1) create counterfactual what-if scenarios e.g. by digitally replaying the gaming sessions with altered parameters or attributes (2) scale up gaming sessions e.g. by expanding spatial and temporal dimensions (3) continuously update the characteristics of the environment and agents to react to player actions as the game unfolds and (4) provide generative properties (i. e. population level phenomena originating from local interactions) and the ability to model dynamics. In the same context games can provide a platform for players (e.g. stakeholders) to discuss and agree how best to manage real-life challenges (Salvini et al. 2016) or collectively create development scenarios (Voinov & Bousquet 2010). Moreover they can help understand heterogeneous behavioural strategies and interactions among players. This particular strength can be used either to develop plausible context-specific behavioural ABMs or for validation purposes (e.g. by comparing the behaviours of players in the game with those of the computational agents). A significant trait of both games and ABMs is that they can input and output qualitative as well as quantitative data. Depending on the research design sequence data can feed from the game to the ABM or vice versa. Previous research examined games and ABMs applications in a participatory context (Voinov & Bousquet 2010; Voinov et al. 2018 2016). In these three studies games are limited to roleplaying games (RPGs) with stakeholders and fall into one of two types: (1) companion modelling which is usually associated with a stakeholder process that involves a combination of ABMs and RPGs with the aim of co-designing a system model or (2) participatory simulation in which stakeholders manipulate a dynamic system in the context of a game where every decision and each interaction is registered for further analyses while the settings and the rules of the underlying model cannot be modified by the players. In a systematic literature review Farias et al. (2019) identified four ways to integrate combinations of multiagent systems (MAS) and RPGs in natural resource management: (1) RPG -> MAS where the analogue RPG is used to collect information about a problem and how the stakeholders take their decisions � this information is used to make a MAS; (2) MAS -> RPG where the MAS is developed prior to playing an analogue RPG and it is validated via running the RPG; (3) RPG + MAS where an analogue RPG uses a MAS to calculate game processes; (4) RPG ++ MAS where a computational RPG is developed as software that integrates MAS calculations. The presented results are significant but limited in their applicability because of the small dataset and limited scope of the review. Our study tries to overcome these limitations by analysing an extensive dataset rooted in the entire disciplinary spectrum of GAM applications. INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY 3 2.2 Criteria for describing games and ABMs research designs In order to identify and categorise research designs used in GAM we determined three criteria that we then applied in this study: sequencing target system and game/ABM correspondence. We borrowed the first and the third criteria from mixed methods research (Cresswell & Clark 2017). The second criterion was chosen because it sets the boundaries of the ABM and of the game model. ? Sequencing refers to the relationship between research components over time (Morgan 2017). In our case a sequence describes the order in which game and ABM components are designed (and sometimes implemented) in a particular study. The sequence influences the flow of information between elements usually from the first to the second. Analysing sequencing games and ABMs can be combined in three ways: a game is followed by an ABM a game follows an ABM and the two can be merged in a single application. ? The target system describes the real-world phenomenon under investigation (Elliott-Graves 2020). Both games and ABMs are designed as simplified models of the studied phenomenon where researchers highlight elements significant for a specific question and heavily simplify and/or disregard other features. Therefore we analyse to what extent the game and the ABM highlight the same aspects of the phenomenon investigated. ? Game/ABM correspondence indicates whether the latter component in the research design depends on processes present in the earlier component (Schoonenboom & Johnson 2017). It can also be the case that the two components are completely or partially inseparable. 3 Method In order to address our research questions we employed a systematic literature review (SLR) which is a structured way to gather review and analyse relevant texts followed by content analysis. In emerging fields SLRs can reveal consistencies in practice provide a structure for these and identify areas needing further organisation. At a later stage an SLR can be repeated to re-evaluate findings and observe long-term developments in the field. SLRs have been used in a variety of domains with the purpose to assess developments including natural resource management (Weber et al. 2019) business (Gonz�lez et al. 2010) software engineering (�mite et al. 2010) and social simulation (Farias et al. 2019; Gu & Blackmore 2015). In this study we followed the SLR phases described in (Bearman et al. 2012) and the content analysis methodology as described in (Krippendorff 2012). Figure 1 summarises the steps that were taken during the SLR. Available metadata such as article�s author(s) publication year abstract journal keywords and publication outlet were collected and served as the basis of the screening process in which eight of this article�s co-authors assessed all articles with respect to relevance and eventually included or excluded them from the review. Articles where inclusion was uncertain (based on the screening of title keywords and abstract) underwent additional full-text assessment by two co-authors. To control for inclusion consistency between reviewers two co-authors cross-checked all final decisions for 5% of randomly selected papers. The list of items that were selected for in-depth analysis can be found in Appendix A Table A1. The abstracts and full texts of items selected for investigation were then subjected to content analysis. Qualitative coding was used to identify patterns in the ways games and ABMs were combined. The codebook was developed and tested using a combination of deductive and inductive coding. After finalising the codebook the co-authors harmonised their coding practices through three iterations. After reaching satisfactory reliability we analysed the entire qualitative dataset using NVivo. Figures were made using SPSS 26.0.0.0. After coding we used the categorisation criteria described in Section 2.2 main text to identify recurring research design types. 4 T. SZCZEPANSKA ET AL. In order to identify authorship patterns we identified a study field matching affiliation of the author with the scientific fields descriptors from Marie Sk?odowska-Curie Actions � List of Descriptors (European Commission n.d.). We have also counted the number of authors per article categorised authors as belonging to academic or non-academic domains and assigned a geographical location based on affiliation. The main limitations of the SLR approach are the literature selection process and the population of publications used for analysis. Articles that are not stored in one of the two online databases or do not include our search terms are excluded from the review (Table 1). This means that it is possible that important articles escaped our review. However this is always a price that must be paid for �automated� search of a much larger sample relative to �qualitative� analysis of articles following up references. We did not include any articles after the database search was concluded (on 25.02.2021). Figure 1. Flow of information through the different phases of the systematic literature review.

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY 5 All our findings refer to the sample used for the analysis and therefore have finite generalisability. Although it is a limitation of the study that subjective interpretation of criteria may have affected this categorisation this is the first systematic attempt and is therefore subject to evaluation and further improvements. 4 Results and discussion 4.1 General patterns Combining games with ABMs for the purpose of research (i.e. using the GAM approach) is a relatively new field. The 52 analysed papers were published between 2001 and 2020 (Figure 2). The GAM approach is mainly published in three journals: Environmental Modelling & Software (n = 6) Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation (n = 6) and Journal of Environmental Management (n = 5). The remaining 35 papers were published in 35 different outlets (16 conference proceedings 12 peer-reviewed journals 7 books or book series). Almost one-third of the papers were published as conference proceedings from computer science-oriented conferences. The variety of publication outlets shows that the relatively low number of GAM research projects are widespread over different application areas which paints the image of a scattered field. However eleven publications in this review are from journals that focus on environmental management highlighting the significance of the approach when working with cross-sectoral complex problems. The practice of combining games and ABMs has been growing in popularity (Figure 2). While in our sample the first decade under investigation (2001�2010) produced a total of 14 papers on the topic in the subsequent one (2011�2020) publications increased almost threefold (38 papers). The 2010 peak is traceable to a series of publications in Environmental Modelling and Software driven by an author group publishing on companion modelling while the slight downward trend in 2019 and 2020 is most likely an artefact of our data collection that took place in February 2020. The combination of games and ABMs was applied in 14 different fields showing a high degree of flexibility. The most prominent application domain is natural resource management (54%) followed by group dynamics (14%) public health (6%) and city logistics (4%). This pattern might also reflect the popularity of ABMs in environmental agricultural and biological sciences in general (Figure D1) most probably due to the complexity approach being popularised in these domains in the last 30 years calling for application of mixed methods. Almost half (48%) of the studies used computer-based games a third (31%) used analogue games and a fifth (21%) used games that combined physical and digital elements. The popularity of computer games can be attributed to several factors. They are easy to set up and efficient for tracking data; furthermore an online game makes a study independent of the location because it offers players the possibility to participate from anywhere. Almost all the analogue games were Figure 2. Distribution of publications over time and application domain. 6 T. SZCZEPANSKA ET AL. RPGs. The prevalence of this category of games might be due to the underlying assumption that RPGs can be seen as ABMs that use humans instead of artificial agents. Only in one case (Table A1 #44) a commercial off-the-shelf game was used. The remaining studies used games made for the research purpose or employed games designed or used in previous research applications. The structure of authorships shows that there are no �lone wolves� among the authors and that the field is dominated by small-to-medium collaborations as 70% of publications are authored by two to four scholars. The largest collaboration included 19 authors. Most of the collaborations are international (67%) and established between universities and nonacademic institutions (57%). Non-academic institutions are mostly research institutes and private companies but sporadically also government agencies and hospitals. This reflects the transdisciplinary potential of the GAM approach with cooperation between scientists stakeholders and experts from the (often rural and remote) field. Moreover the authors of the studies included in our dataset have a plurality of research backgrounds. The affiliation of the majority of authors matched �Environmental and Geosciences� (40%) a highly multi- and interdisciplinary domain and �Information Science and Engineering� (39%) a domain where computer models and games are well-known with significantly fewer authors being affiliated with �Social sciences and Humanities� (8%) �Economic Sciences� (4.5%) �Life Sciences� (4.5%) �Physics� (2.3%) �Mathematics� (1%) and �Chemistry� (0.5%). We found two types of collaborations: (1) field studies where specialists cooperate with practitioners in the field oftentimes in international cooperations between research institutions and nonresearch organisations and (2) studies organised around research institutions where cooperating researchers come from different scientific backgrounds. Thus the complexity of applying games and ABMs in a single research design seems to stimulate collaborations. However exact reasons for establishing cooperative efforts were not provided in the analysed papers. It might be difficult for a single scholar to have the knowledge and expertise related to all study components e.g. the methodology and the application field or the methodology and the location of the case study. It is also possible that the complex organisation and execution of the study simply requires the participation of multiple scholars. 4.2 Research design types: description and patterns When applying the three criteria (described in Section 2.2) on the 52 papers included in the content analysis phase of the SLR we identified six types of research designs. These types are visualised and their characteristics are summarized in Table 2. An in-depth description of the data that made up each of these types is given in Appendix B. The research design types have some similarities with those described by Farias et al. (2019) in an SLR that included 10 papers from natural resource management that had used multi-agent systems (MASs) and RPGs. The previous study used sequencing and level of RPG computerization as characterisation criteria. Our types 1 3 and 5 are similar with their integration ways a b and c with respect to sequencing. Our study differentiates three more types: types 2 and 4 because of using the target system as a characterization criterion (inspired by the category shared or different underlying conceptual model in the analysis of the joint use of role-playing games and models in Barreteau (2003); and type 6 because of the simultaneous sequence. Farias et al. (2019) differentiates integration way d because of the level of computerization of the game as a characterization criterion something that our study does not regard. The GAM field is not only increasing in the number of publications but also in variations of applied research design types (see Figure D2). Types 3 5 and 6 are present in the first third of the observation period while the other three types appear later on. The first appearance of type 1 studies was in 2010 with four publications in 1 year. Since then it has slowly faded out with no new publication for the last 4 years. Type 3 studies are distributed over the whole observation period with a slight increase in the fourth quarter. Since both types (1 and 3) can be used for similar research purposes one should also review them in relation. This combined perspective shows a INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY 7 constant distribution with peaks in 2010 and 2015. Although type 6 is an early occurrence in our dataset it became the most popular design type only in the second period. Type 4 studies constitute a recent development in the field. The rising popularity of types 4 and 6 can be attributed to the increase in popularity of (video) games and the increased availability of user-friendly development platforms. While the combination of games and ABMs was applied across many different fields the research design types were not equally distributed (see Figure D3). Almost all research design types (except type 2) are used in natural resource management. Type 6 seems to be the most versatile being used in 10 out of 14 application domains. Research design type 1 finds applications solely in natural resource management while all the other types are present in at least two out of 14 application domains. Type 2 is used exclusively in the two application domains concerned solely with human social behaviour (group dynamics attitude behaviour relation) as opposed to the socioecological or socio-technical systems under investigation in the other domains. This is probably because using a game to elicit knowledge about people�s decision-making and attitudes and then validating these findings via an ABM seems to be especially suitable for studies in these fields. 5 Recommendations for future developments 5.1 General aspects Drawing on the studies included in this SLR we give brief implementation guidance for using each of the research design types and a description of the limitations of the GAM approach. The recommendations provide (especially new) researchers with a helping hand to identify an appropriate design type for their research purpose. These recommendations are useful to ABM Table 2. Description of the six research design types combining games and ABMs identified by this systematic literature review. n = number of articles with corresponding research type. 8 T. SZCZEPANSKA ET AL. developers and game designers alike. We also invite academics and practitioner-researchers to join a methodological discussion and critically reflect on the GAM research design types and provide robust advice in relation to shaping the GAM methodology. Type 1 (Game ? ABM) research design is suited for studies that aim to gather insider and local knowledge to widen the understanding about a specific target system. The purpose is to support decision-making processes by involving stakeholders in the co-construction of an abstract representation of a real-world system i.e. the concept model. The game is used to support the design process of the subsequent ABM. It is employed to create a concept model of the system under investigation through play-testing and debating of the system elements. This concept model outlines the system under investigation and will at a later stage be used as the blueprint for the ABM. The ABM component is then used to present and discuss development scenarios. Type 2 (Game ? ABM) research design is well equipped to support game development. The aim of a type 2 design is to enhance the performance or calibration of game aspects by utilizing ABM. This design is also suitable when recreating a scalable version of the game in silico to explore social patterns and dynamics of players. Type 2 designs aim to use an ABM to understand/analyse the decisions and interactions in the game and sometimes evaluate and compare different theories on cooperation group interactions collective decision-making etc. Type 3 (ABM ? Game) research design has the same aim and purpose as type 1 research designs i.e. gathering player knowledge. Hence the game is used to co-design and discuss system concepts through play-testing and debating its elements in a concept model. Uniquely for type 3 designs the study is initiated with an ABM and subsequently a game is created to mirror the basic concepts of the ABM. This sequence allows for model validation to improve or undergird an existing ABM with knowledge gathered through the game. Type 3 designs aim to verify validate or calibrate the simulation. Type 4 (ABM ? Game) research design aims to enrich ABMs with more realistic agent behaviours or to compare implemented agents to real humans. In this design games are utilized in controlled settings (e.g. experiments) to track behaviour of players during gameplay. On the basis of the gathered data new agent behaviours are then created or existing agent behaviours are validated. Type 4 designs aim to use games to investigate questions revealed by the construction and analysis of the ABM. Type 5 (Game + ABM) research design use ABMs to calculate and present the effect of players� actions on the gameworld during the gameplay e.g. to demonstrate the effects of players� decisions and actions on the environment parameters such as groundwater level land production government budget etc. Therefore at each game-turn the gameworld parameters get updated based on the ABM processes and new values are presented to the players. As such the game will not be able to run without the ABM and its results. Type 5 designs aim to implement ABM as a (sub-) component of the game. Type 6 (ABM = Game) research designs combine an ABM and a game in one fully integrated application i.e. agent-based game. This approach is particularly suitable for decision support tools but studies utilizing the design can also be used for all previously mentioned study purposes. The integration of game and ABM comes with strong ups- but also downsides. On the one hand using this type of research design makes data integration between the game and ABM obsolete. On the other hand this design limits the possibilities of players to show unexpected gameplay e.g. by modifying the game rules or implementing �house rules�. Type 6 designs aim to use an ABM to provide the infrastructure for game interaction and play. When considering using any of these research design types one has also to be aware of the limitations of the GAM approach. Implementing this approach requires a double set of design and implementation skills i.e. for games and for ABM. In addition one has to have the knowledge of combining the two in an effective way. To the authors� knowledge with the exception of this current study there is only one overview of general methodological approaches in combining games and ABMs (i.e. the analysis of six cases by the initiators of the companion modelling approach by INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY 9 Bousquet et al. 2002). Implementing a GAM study is a time and labour-intensive process. Therefore it is recommended to plan well in advance both the time needed to acquire the necessary skills and the time to implement the combination of games and ABMs. Interestingly papers included in the review frequently lack a clarification of basic concepts e.g. a study purpose or research questions. Moreover explanations of the reasons behind design choices and how they are translated into a specific combination of games and ABMs are non-existent or unstructured. Consequently it is unclear if a GAM research design is fit for purpose. Therefore the classification of some studies was generally challenging because the texts did not include sufficient details or explicit descriptions for identifying a clear sequence distinguishing between the target systems or describing the game/ABM correspondence. We also realized that the uneven distribution between sections documenting the game and the ABM components of GAM is because while there is a call for rigour in game modelling (Raghothama & Meijer 2018) there are no schemes for game documentation. There are however several protocols available for reporting ABM (e.g. Overview Design concepts and Details Protocol (Grimm et al. 2020) Rigor and Transparency Reporting Scheme (Siebers et al. 2021)). 5.2 Games and agent-based models (GAM) documentation scheme To facilitate writing and reading of research methods descriptions enable replication of GAM research and further the field through structuring it and using a GAM-specific vocabulary we recommend practitioners to use a simple documentation scheme as outlined here. It should be noted that this is just a first attempt to design such a scheme and requires further study and validation in future. We welcome feedback on the content use and usefulness of this scheme (printable version in Appendix C). A) General aspects: (1) Purpose of the study. [open ended] (2) Research questions of the study.

As the GAM approach profits from the enormous popularity of digital and analogue games and the ability of ABMs to tame complexity it can be scaled up in three dimensions: (1) Quantity of data: By using online games for data collection researchers can attract big crowds to participate in the research process. Using games in research also takes advantage of the tendency of humans to spend many hours engaging in games. This allows researchers to collect data from many sources and over an extended period of time. (2) Quality of research: Standardising the GAM methodology will allow researchers from various fields to replicate research designs adequate for specific research settings. Using GAM applications tailored to investigate player behaviour in small groups can lead to a new wave of context-specific insights on human group dynamics and social behaviour. (3) Empowerment of INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SOCIAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY 11 stakeholders: Creating compelling and engaging environments for participants to engage in research processes will increase the impact and sustainability of decision-making processes that build on stakeholder involvement. Employing a systematic literature review this study identified six research design types that characterize the GAM approach. This characterization describes the current state of the field and helps to introduce the GAM approach to new research domains. The functional range of these design types is wide with applications in 15 domains that mainly focus on decision-making and managing complex systems. The six types can accommodate any type of game: analogue digital and hybrid. This makes the GAM approach a highly versatile tool. We describe these six types by explaining key concepts of their designs: sequence correspondence between game and ABM how they represent target systems and their purpose. In order to help newcomers in the field we give advice in what circumstances each design can be used. The six types provide a framework for scientists to communicate their work by relating it to a broader context without the danger of reinventing (re-labelling) existing concepts. The gained transparency and definiteness of the categories set the scope for methodological discussions that can lead to advancements in the field and the documentation of applications. In addition the overview helps to identify novel research designs that have not been categorized in this review. To consolidate the GAM field we propose to keep track of the design and implementation of studies combining games and ABMs by using a dedicated documentation scheme as suggested here. To further the field a thorough description of each of the six design types is needed together with detailed expositions of implementation examples that open the black box of how specific combinations of games and ABMs can integrate qualitative and quantitative data. Increased cooperation between ABM practitioners from any application domain and members of the games community (designers players researchers etc.) is needed in order to achieve the full potential of the GAM approach.

The pandemic is also posing severe challenges to the scientific community with scholars under pressure to respond topolicymakers� demands for advicedespite the absence of adequate trusted data. Understanding the pandemic requires fine-grained data representing specific local conditions and the social reactions of individuals. While experts have built simulation models to estimate disease trajectories that may be enough to guide decision-makers to formulate policy measures to limit the epidemic they do not cover the full behavioural and social complexity of societies under pandemic crisis. Modelling that has such a large potential impact upon people�s lives is a great responsibility. This paper calls on the scientific community to improve the transparency access and rigour of their models. It also calls on stakeholders to improve the rapidity with which data from trusted sources are released to the community (in a fully responsible manner). Responding to the pandemic is a stress test of our collaborative capacity and the social/economic value of research. Keywords: COVID-19 Pandemic Disease Agent-Based Models Modelling Policy Data The COVID-19 Global Challenge 1.1 The news on 24 March 2020 announced that in a few weeks the SARS-CoV-2 virus had already infected almost 390000 persons and the associated COVID-19 disease killed more than 16000 worldwide with early peaks in China Italy Iran Spain and France. One of the most shocking pictures of the outbreak in Italy was taken during the night of 18 March 2020 in Bergamo a rich city around 30 miles northeast of Milan: it shows a long JASSS 23(2) 10 2020 http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/23/2/10.html Doi: 10.18564/jasss.4298 queueof army trucks transportingdozensof coinsoutof townas24-hour crematoriums inBergamowereoverwhelmed. By the time you read this article the situationwill be evenworse and the viruswill be expanding into new places and communities perhaps hitting the crowded places of less developed countries with devastating impact. 1.2 In order to try to contain the contagion and avoid the collapse of their health care systems governments are taking draconian measures that only a few weeks ago might have caused a revolution. Social distancing intensive quarantine lockdown cancellation ofmass gathering events and strict traic restrictions are enforced sometimes even to the extent of using a pervasive system of police and drones. In many countries industries companies small businesses and shops have been shut if they are not essential. This will have longterm economic consequences such as the failure ofmany small businesses and a decline in private investment � consequences related to the severity of policy measures which at the moment do not have a defined expiry date. Politicians are consulting epidemiologists virologists and public health experts in order to try and make informed decisions adapting their responses to contingencies and sometimes reconsidering decisions announced only a few days before. Experts are increasingly featured in the public media and then under pressure to predict when this disease will end to reduce panic. Massive public spending � at levels that will substantially increase deficits � have been enacted. Levels which previously might have caused a breakdown of inter-state relationships with the EU. Some observers have started to blame liberal democracies for their inefficiency while praising the capacity of some authoritarian states (which they considered oppressive only a few weeks before) to respond eectively. 1.3 The current outbreakof COVID-19 is not only causing adramatic loss of livesworldwide challenging the sustainability of our health care systems precipitating an economicmeltdown and putting pressure upon themental health of individuals under quarantine and lock-downmeasures. This outbreak is also challenging the research community pushing scientists beyond their �comfort zone� for two sorts of reason which we now elaborate upon. 1.4 Firstly the need for a rapid response is largely incompatible with the �normal� path of scientific progress which is based on complex and delicate practices of peer review testing and replicability. These practices have been built over time toensure thevalidityof scientific claimsand research findings. Thesystemicnatureof theCOVID19 outbreak requires wide-ranging political decisions about prevention testing and anti-contagionmeasures. Thesedecisions cannot be solely basedonepidemiological knowledge because the eicacyof implementation depends on people�s reactions pre-existing social norms and structural societal constraints. For instance the same lock-down policy aimed at reducing the number of infected elderly might have dierent eects when implemented in a country where several generations live together and a country where elderly live alone but are still very active in their communities e.g. in religious or neighbourhood associations. 1.5 Tackling thechallengeof respondingwith rigorous research toacomplexglobalproblem isadiicult endeavour even in normal times. In a crisis the �default� response is to convert/adapt existing models to the new context ideally by fitting it to newly available data. While this could reasonably be seen as the best way forward given the speedwithwhich the virus is spreading the dependency on the quality of available data and the underestimation of theoretical premises and original intentions of re-used models can make this of questionable rigour (Edmonds et al. 2019). 1.6 Respondingwith rigorous research toa complex global problem is evenmoreproblematic in timesof crisis. This is due to: public pressure for immediate responsesmisplacedexpectationsabout the roleof sciencemisunderstanding about the certainty of scientific knowledge and confusion concerning public responsibility. The same political leaders who endorsed without any modesty public statements similar to the �we have had enough of experts� (a statement by Michael Gove who was Minister for the Cabinet Oice in the United Kingdom � a statement he later qualified) are now turning to scientists for advice or recommendations on decisions that are politically controversial. Public discourse makes it diicult for politicians to alter course (�U-turn�) in the light of new scientific evidence even if it is to their credit that they do so. Indeed public perceptions of science itself are not helped by disagreements among scientists concerning the reliability of findings. Moreover although politicians are (or ought to be) aware that responsibility for decisions eventually lie solely with them as their society�s elected representatives they can seek to dodge this � blaming scientists if informed decisions turn out to be wrong or glorifying themselves in case decisions turn out to be good. 1.7 Secondly it is rare for any crisis to lie comfortably within the domain of a single discipline. Even if we squarely consider the COVID-19 an epidemiological problem our responses to it have environmental ecological political socio-psychological and economic aspects and systemic cascading eects are able to be fully understood only if multi- and interdisciplinary perspectives are considered. Integrating knowledge from all of these disciplinary perspectives is suiciently diicult (e.g. Voinov & Shugart 2013) that integration itself should be JASSS 23(2) 10 2020 http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/23/2/10.html Doi: 10.18564/jasss.4298 a recognized specialism (Bammer 2017). We must remember that the dangers of excessive specialisation are well-documented even in less problematic conditions (Thompson Klein 1990). 1.8 In this context it is not surprising that agent-based modelling is under the spotlight. When policy decisions and people�s reactions depend on perceptions of the future and scenarios are probabilistic and largely unpredictable computer simulationmodels are seen as a viablemethod to project future states of a system frompast ones in a non-trivialmanner. Whatwe see today inmanymedia are predictions of the exponential growth of the number of infected persons based on equations that capture stylized populations and the distributions of their dierent states. However any social or behavioural scholar can spot that these projections do not consider relevant factors of social complexity which are intrinsically crucial to the modelled dynamics and a negligible exogenous force. Not recognizing social complexity can undermine the credibility of findings and thus we call for urgent initiatives to: (1) improve the transparency and rigour of models to understand theoretical premises and details and (2) promote data access to help contextualize and validatemodels across various levels of analysis (i.e. micro meso and macro). This call is even more urgent when simulation findings can rapidly aect public policy decisions (e.g. on possible consequences of certain policy scenarios) and/or motivate individual actions (e.g. impact upon decisions to stay at home to �flatten the curve�). 1.9 To improve the quality impact and appropriate use of computer simulation models in this delicate situation wewill in this paper first briefly review recent agent-basedmodels of COVID-19 to bring out their potential and emphasize any existing explanatory gaps. While the number of publications preprints and simulation tools on immediate responses to COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly increasing due to the attention of scholars and public pressure it is important to discuss some important challenges involved and suggest counter-measures to avoid collective mistakes. Secondly we will reflect on the problematic interface between modelling and policy in order to better understand problems related to excessive expectations about scientific knowledge arising from a misunderstanding of the nature of science. Finally we will suggest measures to reduce these gaps and improve the relationship between science and public policy via a call for extensive collaboration between public stakeholders and academic scholars in terms ofmodel and data sharing. The credibility of science has recently been under attack from various communities including anti-vaxxers climate change deniers creationists flatearthers fake news propagators and conspiracy theorists but also from some philosophers and critical sociologists. While it is desirable that academic experts have greater public visibility and take a lead in public debate by explicating the evidence the unfolding of this pandemic carries the risk of undermining science if we do not take the necessary precautions � for example clarifying the boundaries and limits of presented conclusions/recommendations. Science could be the scapegoat if the public is seeking someone to blame. Potential of and Gaps in COVID-19 Agent-Based Models 2.1 Modelling in epidemiology has a venerable tradition since the 1920s when dierential equations were used to model the population distribution of disease spread including susceptible infected and recovered/dead pools. While this approach has helped to understand the threshold nature of epidemics and herd immunity suchmodels could not examine important social and behavioural factors such as the behavioural responses of individuals to policy measures and the eect of heterogeneous social contacts on diusion patterns (Epstein 2009). Progresshasbeenmadesince the 1990s inmodellingepidemiologicaldiseasesespecially throughagentbased simulations that include some important sources of population heterogeneity and explore the structure and dynamics of transmission networks (e.g. Stroud et al. 2007; Yoneyama et al. 2012; Zhang et al. 2016; Hunter et al. 2017). However whenever an outbreak suddenly occurs such as the one into which we have all been thrusted in the lastmonth severalmodelling problems emerge that require careful attention. These include: (1) predicting complex outcomes when crucial data is unreliable/unavailable and theories are underdetermined; (2) repurposing models outside their original purposes by confusing original illustrative/explanatory purposes with prediction (see Edmonds et al. 2019); (3) ignoring good practices of model transparency and rigour either due to the race for public/academic relevance or because of political pressures for immediate responses. 2.2 The case of the Imperial College COVID-19 model which has contributed to reshaping the political agenda in many countries illustrates these challenges. Based on an adaptation of an individual-based simulation model onH5N1 (Fergusonet al. 2005) and influenza (Fergusonet al. 2006) inmid-March a teamof the Imperial College published a report in which they predicted a huge number of people would die in Britain unless severe policy measures were taken. Their results also helped to assess the eicacy of isolation household quarantine and the closing of schools and universities. These results were quickly endorsed by the UK government (aer some initial hesitation) influenced the US administration and alerted the French administration in their attempt at trying to minimize the mortality rate in their countries due to the transmission of the global pandemic.1 JASSS 23(2) 10 2020 http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/23/2/10.html Doi: 10.18564/jasss.4298 2.3 The core of the Imperial Collegemodel consists of households schools andworkplaces that are geographically distributed to represent thecountryunder study traveldistancepatterns (within thecountryand international) workplace school and household size and other demographic data. However the exact internals of themodel are not described in any detail and no one has yet accessed themodel code.2 Maybe this is because themodel waswrittenmore than 13 years ago byNeil Ferguson the Imperial College team leader and includes thousands of line of undocumented code as admitted in a recent tweet.3 2.4 Considering its impact and relevance the Imperial College model has been criticized for various reasons: (a) it does not enable the consideration of other policy options (b) it does not use suicient data across dierent contexts while claiminggeneral findings (c) it doesnot help tounderstand social conditions andconsequences of measures. For instance Shen et al. (2020) focused on (a) and explored the eicacy of strict contact tracing pre-emptive testing on a large scale and super-spreader events. They also focused on the model�s inability to study the consequences of local dynamics at the micro level rather than the aggregated level of the data available and the lack of attention to compliance dynamics which depend on behavioural and social factors. They concluded that the Imperial Collegemodelwas �several degrees of abstraction away fromwhat iswarranted by the situation�. Considering the policy and predictive purposes of the Imperial College model Colbourn (2020) called formore context-specificmodels of the social and economic eects of lockdown and other interventions and knock-on eects on health including mental health and interpersonal violence via careful empirical evaluation. 2.5 Unfortunately even the available examples of more specific and empirically calibrated microsimulation models neglect important behavioural and social factors. For instance Chang et al. (2020) proposed amicrosimulation model calibrated on empirical data to inform pandemic response planning in Australia (see the origins of AceMod-Australian Census-based Epidemic Model in Cli et al. 2018). Themodel captures average characteristics of the Australian population by simulating over 24 million individuals with heterogeneous attributes (e.g. age occupation individual health characteristics) and their social context (dierent contact rates and contexts such as households neighbourhoods schools or workplaces) whose distributions are taken from the 2016 Australian census. In a similar vein IndiaSIM from the Center for Disease Dynamics Economics & Policy (see: https://cddep.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/covid19.indiasim.March23-2-eK.pdf) was calibrated with data from the 2018-2019 census data of the Indian population and available data fromChina and Italy to estimate the force of infection age- and gender-specific infection rates severe infection and case-fatality rates. However although better calibrated than previous models these do not capture network eects nor people�s reactive responses as the population states simply change via stochastic (randomized) processes determined by parameters (although the parameters derive from the data). 2.6 Independently of their specific characteristics all of thesemodels are either weak in terms of empirical calibrationor theoreticallyunderdeterminedorboth. Indeed noneof themarebasedonexplicit empirical/theoretical assumptions of individual behaviour social transmission mechanisms and social structure constraints. Not only does this imply a very abstract conceptualisation of populations and behaviours: it alsomisses the chance to understand people�s response to policy measures due to pre-existing behavioural attitudes network eects and social norms. While the lack of appropriate data on a country or region�s socio-economic structure e.g. household structures or geographical clustering of population canmake amodel�s parameter calibrationproblematic this should not be an excuse to: (a) repurposemodels that are purely illustrative or intended to provide a theoretical exposition for predicting complex social outcomes (b) suppress the attention to behavioural and social factors which are critical to estimate the eicacy of advocatedmeasures because data are not available. 2.7 This suggests that any model must be considered depending on its purposes and has associated values and risks for public use. Edmonds et al. (2019) listed seven modelling purposes: prediction explanation description theoretical exposition illustration social learning andanalogy. In theAppendix we tried to consider each of these purposeswith a view to evaluating the role the correspondingmodelsmight play in a crisis context the potential usefulness theymight have todecision-makers and the risks associatedwith their use (manyofwhich are general to all models not just agent-basedmodels). For instance in response to the lack of behavioural realism in many of the currently used in the public debate there has been a proliferation of examples of open source agent-based implementations though authors admitted that they are probably simply illustrations.4 While this tellsmore about the academic eervescence and selective attention that typically characterise emergencies and outbreaks the competitive advantage of the Imperial College model and similar models which at thepresent stagecannotbe seriously testedby thecommunitymakes theseeortsof uncertain value for immediate responses whereas they could be relevant for understanding long-term socio-economic consequences of policy measures. 2.8 In short the modelling practices that we developed in �normal� times need to be reconsidered during a global outbreak as this global event poses key modelling challenges. The first one is a COVID-19 prediction chalJASSS 23(2) 10 2020 http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/23/2/10.html Doi: 10.18564/jasss.4298 lenge. Prediction of complex systems displaying all sorts of non-linearities heterogeneities and sensitivities is very challenging independently of the scientific method used to tackle the problem agent-based modelling included (Edmonds et al. 2019). We all are experiencing in real life the concepts and analogies that have made the fortunes of complex systems theorists such as the famous �butterfly eect� in chaos theory (Mitchell 2009). Complex systems researchers are aware that small unnoticed events possibly identified only in retrospect may generate unforeseen large-scale consequences (Vespignani 2009). Awareness of significant limitations such as the nature of complexity but also lack of data ontological diversity or the variety of approaches to simulating human behaviour algorithmically can make prediction diicult if not impossible and oen even undesirable (Polhill 2018; Edmonds et al. 2019). 2.9 Therefore modelling experts strive to minimise the limitations �make their model assumptions valid with respect to thenewSARS-CoV-2 virus and their calibration rooted in themost accurate availabledata (e.g.Wuet al. 2020). However during the current COVID-19 pandemic accurate data suitable for complexity-friendly agentbasedmodels are not yet available and this inhibits agent-basedmodellers� ability to produce amuch-needed rapid response. At the same time other scientific communities make bolder claims even though the same or similar limitations apply to their methods. In late November/early December 2019 when the SARS-CoV-2 virus probably emerged (Andersen et al. 2020) it was impossible to precisely estimate the scale and global consequences of the COVID-19 disease. At the time orwriting fourmonths later even thoughwe are aware of the rate of loss of human life minimally attributable to the pandemic precise estimation of the death toll at the end of the crisis is still out of scientific reach. So is the estimation of its direct and indirect consequences worldwide. Nonetheless developing probabilistic scenarios that can reliably inform policy decisions is an important goal. 2.10 This calls for a second important challenge: The COVID-19modelling human behaviour challenge. The complex social dynamics related to transmission response and compliance (mentioned above) arise from the behaviours of individuals. Research in psychology and decision making has recognized for years that humans do not follow predictable optimal decision-making even in a laboratory and without deep uncertainty. In times of crisis findings suggest that cognition is impaired and that traumatic experiences can cause psychological distress and cognitive distortions (Agaibi &Wilson 2005; Liu et al. 2012). A review recently published psychological eects of quarantine including post-traumatic stress symptoms confusion and anger (Brooks et al. 2020) � all factors that have long-lasting consequences on decision making and behaviour including compliance. Modelling the complexity of human behaviour social interaction and the diusion of collective behaviours or opinions has been at the core of much agent-based modelling (Squazzoni et al. 2014; Flache et al. 2017). Although the incorporation of agents� heterogeneity in terms of cognitions and behaviours in epidemiological models is a diicult task and would require cross-disciplinary collaboration (Squazzoni 2010) there are examples of models using socio-economic data to estimate behavioural heterogeneity in epidemiological diseases (e.g. Hunter et al. 2017 2018). Although constructing more complex models takes time and eort requiring cross-disciplinary teams andmaybe lowering the rapidity of response to public emergencies it is nonetheless necessary to build better models. Indeed when trying to estimate the consequences of policy measures that depend on heterogeneous responses it is oen the case that population outcomes are contingent on specific sets of circumstances that arise from social interaction and its non-linear eects. Models that cannot examine the social dynamics of COVID-19 contagion are missing a crucial aspect that has serious implications for any possible estimation scenario or prediction. We need to use better informed assumptions of the way in which individuals� and communities� behaviours will change as an eect of the epidemic. Agents are not simply virus carriers and their preferences and actions have implications at multiple levels. 2.11 This calls for a third important challenge: TheCOVID-19 data calibration and validation challenge. Model validation is very challenging when the model has a predictive purpose. This is because sometimes data are unavailable and/or there are no parallel situations that can be drawn on to to independently test predictive ability andhence build confidence inmodel findings. During emergencies experimental samples or testsmight be impossible or unethical (Hunter et al. 2017). Without appropriate data validation can be improved by empiricallygrounded theoretical knowledge and domain competence which can be the bases for a more adequate representation of the complexity of the system. This motivates our plea on the importance of cross-disciplinary collaboration when simulating epidemiological diseases which intertwines behavioural social and economic dimensions (An et al. 2020). While availability of data is crucial for valid model assumptions retrospective validation of predictive models is also possible during the unfolding of an event. For instance Zi & Zi (2020) using WHO data (World Health Organization 2020) analysed the number of deaths due to COVID-19 and challenged the assumption of a fixed reproduction rate of the virus which determines the temporal exponential growth of the number of infected and deceased. However fine-tuning parameters of a predictive model via empirical validation tests during an event whenmodel predictions inform public decisions on the same event can generate confusions. JASSS 23(2) 10 2020 http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/23/2/10.html Doi: 10.18564/jasss.4298 2.12 The problem is that the kind of data with the fine-grained quality needed to calibrate and validate COVID-19 models are (if any) dispersed fragmented and rarely available in a comparable timewindow scale and format. All data are subject to biases andCOVID-19-relateddata are no exception. Even the simple task of estimating the number of COVID-19 cases requires that scientists decision makers and public refer to the number of persons who tested positive for the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus with sophisticated tests such as RT-PCR (WHO Laboratory testing for COVID-19 in suspected human cases). However these numbers are dependent not only on the actual number of infected individuals but also for instance on: the testing capabilities in a given geographical region the sensitivity/specificity of a given test the same definition of �cases� and the willingness of the testing authority to make undistorted data available (Lai et al. 2020). This is exemplified by the case of Italy where the fatality rate is high and unequally distributed because regions have followed dierent testing approaches while the health authorities have tested only persons who already have two of three symptoms and have never performed random tests. In short building predictive models based on the number of cases without considering how cases were defined and data collected can lead to biased estimations. Such obstacles raise questions about the comparability of available oicial statistics between countries which are used to estimate the number of potential infected in each country. Even if collected and processed with utmost scrutiny publicly available data reporting the number of confirmed cases almost certainly greatly underestimates the number of infected and consequently the number of recovered individuals. This fundamental deficiency can have dramatic calibration/validation consequences if a model aims to predict contagion trends and estimate the eicacy of policies at various time scales. The Policy-Modelling Interface 3.1 Theprevious section discussed how the quality of amodel depends on its purpose its theoretical assumptions the level of abstraction and the quality of data. A further issue is that good COVID-19 pandemicmodels are not always good policy advice models. For example a perfect strategy to prevent new infections (e.g. a total shutdown)mightmean long-term harm to important societal system functions and survival mechanisms. A healthfocussed model concentrating on the process of infection transmission will not automatically provide insights concerning long-term economic consequences or implications for social well-being hard though it may seem to be eectively considering trading o such ramifications against the immediate threat of mortality. In other words a particular modelling focus can limit the arena for debate (Aodha & Edmonds 2017). 3.2 Scientific policy advice to inform political debates and decisions about the pandemic should be based on the empirical monitoring and assessment of social contexts including ex ante evaluation and appraisal of potential futures policy options and scenarios as well as on epidemiological models (Weingart & Lentsch 2009; Wrasai & Swank 2007; Jasano 2004; Weaver et al. 2001). However the complex characteristics of the social world generate many possibilities and options. The complexity of social reality refutes a �blueprint for social engineering on the grand scale� (Popper 1972 p. 267) although the social sciences can teach us much about empirical regularities in social actions and social systems. 3.3 Computational simulation models generating macro phenomena from micro dynamics have the potential to provide some expert advice for public policy making (Gilbert et al. 2018; Ahrweiler et al. 2015) especially in areas where empirical data is scarce or of bad quality such as in the current outbreak. However the validity of scientific policy advice in this domainneeds tobehandledwith care honesty and responsibility. The limitations ofmodels and the policy recommendations derived from themhave to be openly communicated and transparently addressed. This applies not only to recognising missing insuicient or bad-quality data for calibrating andvalidatingmodels but also toadmitting the fundamental complexities andcontingenciesof social systems which require a holistic approach to capture eects of policy measures across the boundaries of sub-systems. 3.4 Under pressure to respond immediately and the social expectations of expert judgement the temptation is to turn to simple models with few variables high predictive claims and clear messages to policymakers. But especially in cases of so-called X-events (i.e. human-caused rare unexpected events that cause a system to shi abruptly from one state to another; see Casti 2012 such as pandemic outbreaks the need for complexityappropriate and empirically validated models is higher than ever. Even then merely creating a good model is no guarantee that the conclusions that modellers draw from it will be translated into policy. 3.5 One of the problems that arises when translating the conclusions of modelling into policy is managing the potentially fraught relationship between scientific expertise and democratic decisionmaking. There are dierent functional logics for producing legitimacy in science and in policy the former internally by peer review and the latter externally by elections. Trying to bring these two closer together oen ends with a loss of legitimacy for both: by �politicising science� and by the �scientification of politics� (Weingart 1999). This is complicated by JASSS 23(2) 10 2020 http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/23/2/10.html Doi: 10.18564/jasss.4298 the �expert dilemma� (Collins & Evans 2007) that it is usually rather easy for every political position to find an expert willing to provide scientific evidence to support their own position leading to competing expertise sets. This can lead to scientific advice being treated asmerely symbolic or rhetorical as it can be observed in the current COVID-19 public and media discourse where experts seem more oen to be asked to legitimise political decisions. 3.6 Modelling and simulation can remedy someof these issues by providing support for �evidence-based policy� (a term from themid-nineties in the wake of the evidence-basedmedicine approach) (Pawson 2006). As outlined inGilbert et al. (2018) forpolicyevaluationweneeddataabout theactual situationwith thepolicy implemented to compare with data about the situation if the policy were not implemented. To obtain the latter randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been seen as the �gold standard� as they are in evidence-based medicine. However RCTs in policy contexts are oen diicult and expensive to organise and are sometimes not feasible for examplewhen the policy is available to all and so there is no possible control group or even ethical. Simulation models can be used to create virtual worlds onewith and onewithout the implementation of the policy to obtain an evidence base to inform �knowledge-based policy� (Gilbert et al. 2018) � they can explicitly represent (and hence make available for critique) a �theory of change� that can tell us when the results of an RCT can be applied to a dierent context (Cartwright & Hardie 2012). 3.7 Asecondareaofdiiculty inmanaging themodelling-policy interface is a still prevalent conceptualisationof the relationship between science and policy that marginalises the expertise of professionals and other stakeholders. There are many theories about the role of scientific policy advice: decisionistic technocratic pragmatic or recursive (Lentsch & Weingart 2011). However all of these assume that scientific elites interact directly only with political elites. 3.8 The current situation around COVID-19 shows howmany diverse stakeholder interests are involved in shaping the implementation of knowledge-based policy agendas. Problem solutions require behaviour change on a global scale changes to societal routines and practices and new approaches to economic organisation and social well-being. Thus policy agendas are big societal projects that to be eective have to be supported by all members of society building on their knowledge experience and expertise. Agendas and the underlying models supporting these agendas must be informed not only by the elites but by all relevant stakeholders and practitioners if they are to be successful and sustainable. 3.9 In our �experimental societies� (Gross & Krohn 2005) where experimentation manipulations and policies are ubiquitous and generate reflexivity and performativity of outcomes it is diicult learn how to coordinate transformation processes around global challenges such as COVID-19 in a participativeway. However in complexitybased realistic modelling and simulation there is already an emerging awareness of how to integrate stakeholder interests and expertise. Involving stakeholders in policy andmanagementmodelling activities has been extensively applied in socio-ecologicalmanagement (Jones et al. 2009;Mendoza&Prabhu 2006; Robles-Morua et al. 2014). An example of doing so is the �Companion Modelling� framework (Barreteau et al. 2003; �tienne 2013). 3.10 Although policy modelling for policy advice shares the complexity of the target (Geyer & Cairney 2015) it can be also seen as a straightforward service activity with policymakers and policy analysts as clients who contract modellers under demanding budget and time restrictions (Ahrweiler et al. 2019). Usually a high immediate utility of results and short deadlines aremandatory requirements of any policy advice project using computational models (e.g. Aodha & Edmonds 2017). This requires a lean and systematic process among modellers and policymakers to develop appropriate support to help stakeholders and policy actors engage with and benefit from those with modelling and assessment expertise by establishing a set of resources to help both sides negotiate the relationship (e.g. Jager & Edmonds 2015). 3.11 An important part of this eort will be to improve the interface between modellers and policymakers recognising the requirements of each. From the perspective of a policymaker advice needs to be specific concise relevant to their immediate concerns and accompanied by a plausible narrative. From the point of view of a modeller advice needs to recognize the inherent uncertainty of conclusions drawn from the model and avoid oversimplification. Both modellers and policymakers need to accept that �evidence� no matter how strong is just one ingredient in political decision-making to bemixed in with others such as political expediency public opinion practicality and so on. 3.12 Involvingpolicymakers at the very earliest stagesofmodelling (that is �co-design�) canhelp bygivingmodellers a tacit understanding of the policymaking context and policymakers a feel for the uncertainties and assumptions that are unavoidable in policy modelling. An alternative is to encourage the use of �knowledge brokers� that is peoplewho can bridge the gap betweenmodelling and policymaking preferably drawing on experience of both. Independent �think tanks� and analytic divisions within government can oen perform such a role. JASSS 23(2) 10 2020 http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/23/2/10.html Doi: 10.18564/jasss.4298 3.13 In addition modellers can make their models more useful for informing policy for example by ensuring that updating amodel with newdata can be done easily and quickly (as is done inweather forecasting for example see Kalnay 2003. For COVID-19models thiswouldmean that their calibrationwould be updated perhaps daily to assimilate the latest infection andmortality data. If appropriate models can also be adapted to become the basis for �serious games� (Cannon-Bowers 2010; Zhou 2014) in which stakeholders can interact with the model and explore the implications of policy options. 3.14 Modellers also need to be prepared for their advice to fall on deaf ears if the policy issues are not salient at the time� policy advice is most influential during �windows of opportunity� (Kingdon & Stano 1984) moments when there is coincidence of policy interest possible solutions and implementation opportunities. They also need to understand that policy making is itself a political process in which advocacy coalitions compete for influence and may set the �framing� for an issue. Such framing can heavily influence the search for relevant evidence. For example it can influence the design of a computational model and the choice of policy options to be examined. As noted abovemodelling requiresmaking decisions onmatters such as the boundaries of the domain to bemodelled the degree of abstraction the theory of change implied by themodel the assumptions about unmeasurable parameters and so on. These decisions are oenmade implicitly based on the designer�s or policy maker�s framing of the policy issue. A danger is that a dominant coalition with an accepted model can use it to support their policy for long periods simply updating the model over time while leaving its basic assumptions unchanged (Kolkman et al. 2016). A Call to Action 4.1 Our community has made considerable progress in improving the methodological rigour and transparency of agent-based modelling with a special attention to model documentation and sharing for replicability. The establishment of CoMSES (an online clearinghouse for model codes and documentation) initiatives such as the Open Modelling Foundation and journal policies to enforce the adoption of open science principles have provided relevant infrastructures to the field that have improved assessment and replicability. Defending these principles and practices is necessary in normal times; it is even more vital in periods of public pressures and political uncertainty. Firstly a lack of rigorous cross-checks by experts on models could have serious consequences if findings that inform public decisions turn out to be based on brittle assumptions or simply contain mistakes. This could reverberate on the reputationof thewhole community. Secondly whenmultiple academic teams build their models from scratch without incrementally developing previously assessed models there is a risk of research waste andmisallocation of resources. 4.2 Given that exceptional times require exceptional responses we call here for: (A) thewhole community of agentbased modellers and computational social scientists working on COVID-19 models to collaborate inmaintaining high standards of model building and committing to best practices of transparency and rigour for replicability; (B) the institutional agencies which have data that could help calibrate and inform COVID-19 models at various national regional local levels of granularity to engage themost trusted scientific associations in setting up data infrastructures in order tomake data available to the academic communitywhile protecting stakeholders� interests. 4.3 As regards to (A) although competition and timely publication of results are essential to the advancement of science theneed for immediate responses in exceptional times and the availability of onlineplatforms for rapid sharing of results (i.e. preprint online archives social media) must not compromise the rigorous methodological standards that are essential for the long-term sustainability of the scientific enterprise. 4.4 There is widespread consensus in the community of agent-based modellers on three best practices: (1) using open source soware and tools (e.g. NetLogo MASON) to build models to minimize obstacles to replication and eective access costs for reviewers and possible re-users; (2) adopting standard protocols to document models that make easier for reviewers and re-users to assess model properties and building blocks while allowing model builders to reflect on the adequacy of their model�s structure and features (Edmonds et al. 2019; Grimm et al. 2020); and (3) using permanent online repositories such as ComSES to archive fully documented models before submission of a paper to a journal to speed up assessment and replicability. We believe that these three practices are all the more important during exceptional times: what the community loses in terms of immediate rapidity of responses to public expectations as a result of complying with these best practices is gained in enhancing its long-term credibility. 4.5 As regards to (B) although immediate sharing of institutional data to help scholars develop more empirically contextualized and customizedmodels is a good idea the kind of data that is necessary to calibrate model parameters and estimate outcomes could require appropriate infrastructures to ensure that sensitive information JASSS 23(2) 10 2020 http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/23/2/10.html Doi: 10.18564/jasss.4298 is properly treated. While relevant benefits are expected when institutions outsource research to the community on a large scale via data sharing there are alternatives that could make this eort manageable in a more responsible way so that the advantages of transparency and open data can be counterbalanced with the priority of protection and security. Benchmarks exist to build customized protocols for data sharing that could be adapted to the purpose of sharing institutional data for agent-based computational research on COVID-19 (e.g. Squazzoni et al. 2020). However this process needs a clear organisation and representative authorities capable of ensuring transparent rules of access and enforcing public interest of data use. In this regard The European Social Simulation Association (ESSA) the largest association for the advancement of social simulation research worldwide and the Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation (JASSS) the flagship journal of the community of agent-basedmodellers established in 1998 have agreed to oer their expertise and facilities to manage this process in the benefit of institutional stakeholders and the community. 4.6 ESSA commits itself to set up a protocol for data sharing that will be jointly developed with any institutional agency interested in sharing data for research. While the association has membership fees and priorities related to strengthening the European research area its international dimension and publicmandatewill help to ensure that any interested teams of scholars independently of their origin and status will have the opportunity of data access through public calls. Public calls will target only interdisciplinary teams formed by at least epidemiologists computer scientists and social and behavioural scientists. The Association also commits itself to opening a campaign to leverage funds anddonations to support this eortwhenever a first institutional agency accepts to collaborate. JASSS commits itself to enforce its policy on transparency andmodel documentation by collaboratingwith CoMSES to streamline peer reviewofmodel codes of anymanuscript on COVID-19 submitted to the journal. This will ensure that code reviewers andmanuscript reviewers will bemutually informed so that competences and resources will be optimized. 4.7 Exceptional times require exceptional decisions and these may benefit from collective creativity. While attention is now focussed on immediate epidemiological challenges the decisions of many governments to contain the pandemic are already having unpredictable consequences on social behaviour social relationships economic processes political agendas and the mental health of millions of individuals. Research will also be needed to understand these long-term consequences which could turn out to be dramatic beyond the immediate public health sphere. Our call for action is an attempt to organise a sustainable collaborative answer to these long-term socio-economic challenges. We praise current initiatives from prestigious institutions such as the Royal Society and some funding agencies to stimulate and support modelling research to address important challenges. ESSA and JASSS are here to help. Appendix Edmonds et al. (2019) listed seven modelling purposes: prediction explanation description theoretical exposition illustration social learning and analogy. Prediction not to be confused with �what my model outputs� entails reliable anticipation of unknown data or knowledge. Explanation is the attempt to provide a possible causal chain from initialization to output that shows why or how a phenomenon of interest could occur. Description is a partial representation of a specific case study of interest with no claim to generality beyond that. Theoretical exposition is when simulations are used to explore general theories or ideas without any necessary connection to the real world. Illustration involves using a simulation to communicate an idea. Analogy is a more informal kind of use of a simulation than theoretical exposition used to help think through ideas in a playful and creative way. Social learning is the use of simulation to represent the shared knowledge of a group. Here in Table 1 we tried to consider eachof thesepurposeswith a view toevaluating the role the corresponding models might play in a crisis context the potential usefulness they might have to decision-makers and risks associated with their use (many of which are general to all models not just agent-basedmodels). JASSS 23(2) 10 2020 http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/23/2/10.html Doi: 10.18564/jasss.4298 Purpose Value in a crisis context Usefulness to decision-makers Risks Prediction Ability to anticipate and compare intervention scenarios (including the consequences of doing nothing). Assessment of uncertainties and development of �robust� policies that minimize maximumregret. Base linenumbers to use in planning. If answers to questions can be derived quickly enough and interventions formalized accurately it could make a valuable contribution to discussion over interventions. Over-relianceon themodel as an �oracle� inappropriate political exposure of developers inability of an eectiveness-focused model to forecast policy utility. Oen the quality of data to calibrate importantmodel parameters is questionable especially during an event. It is alsonotnecessarily thecase that decision-makers will adopt the policy the model recommends. Explanation Explanation could address questions such as how we (might have) arrived at a particular outcome but does not guarantee that the particular causal chain that really led us there is the one simulated. More likely of use in �lessons learned� exercises especially if in conjunctionwith several other models with a similar purpose. Enacting measures that address possible causes rather than the actual causes risks unintended consequences in future. Description A descriptive model could be used to explore scenarios in a heavily constrained context. Unlikely to be of value at the national scale in part because the generalizations needed to model at that scale would be inconsistent with this modelling purpose. Could be used for local levels however. Elements not simulated might prove later to be relevant. Overgeneralization from a model fitted to specific circumstances is also a risk. Possible confusion with prediction. Social Learning Potentially valuable in resolving conflict. The main value is the process by which the model is constructed rather than the model itself. Resolving arguments encouraging people to see others� points of view observing the logical consequences of beliefs. Modelling what people in a group believe does not guarantee relevance beyond the group or to the empirical world. Usual risks of group-work (e.g. groupthink dominant voices) need to be carefully managed by facilitators. Illustration Useful for communication and education of ideas to the general public. Provides a means of communicating reasoning behind policies for dealing with the crisis that may be unpopular Under certain conditions the model may not behave consistently with the communicated ideas. Theoretical Exposition Unlikely to be of value. In a crisis context decisionmakers will have little time for comparing or exploring theories. No (necessary) connection with the real world in this purpose risks over interpretation if attempt is made to use it. Analogy Of little valueother thandistracting the modellers themselves from the psychological consequences of the crisis. Not useful. Over interpretation of findings that merit more rigorous study using say theoretical exposition or explanation purposes.

The model sparked a broad societal debate on social distancing. The model was timely and openly accessible for the public. Its purpose was to illustrate the possible consequences of an (unsuccessful) lock-down and of social distancing on flattening the curve of population contagion. The exact �decision rules� were unclear in the article but the build-up of the storyline from individuals getting infected to limiting movement of individuals was extremely clear. In this model people were susceptible sick or recovered. There was no explicit implementation of mortality due to an editorial decision by the newspaper deeming death to be too cruel for its readers.

All rights reserved.a b s t r a c t Traceability is a tool used by regulators to manage risk in multiple supply chains including supply chains of goods derived from genetically modified organisms human blood seafood products toys and hazardous waste. This tool may help support a variety of claims that range from concern for nature to consumer satisfaction and health. This paper examines the consistency of European Union legislation with the declared objective of the law i.e. to implement a traceability system through the entire supply chain. This analysis is undertaken by benchmarking 30 European Union laws that introduced traceability in the supply chain of 16 groups of products. The conclusion is that one-half of these norms lack basic effective principles of traceability. The approaches implemented were strongly correlated with the original driver for risk management (for example concern for environmental sustainability) moderately correlated with the type of goods involved and uncorrelated with their trade value. The paper forecasts traceability approaches for new products and indicates how traceability systems can become operative regardless of product and driver. In addition the importance that the legal provisions are consistent with the declared objective of the law is discussed. This integrated view is useful for regulators industry and consumers in general and provides legislators and businesses with guidelines for consistent application of traceability which facilitates other processes such as life cycle analysis. Concurrently it provides the public with an understanding of what lies behind the (often) inaccessible wording of legal norms. � 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.1. Introduction Many consumers have been disturbed by recent disclosures in the media including the presence of horsemeat in products such as beef lasagne or by the production of garments by under-paid workers or children. Over the past 20 years the claims that many products must comply with such as quality security and environmental sustainability (sensu (Goodland 1995)) have diversified significantly following market and consumer demand. Supply chains in a number of unrelated fields must obey strict quality and safety requirements. They must also consider demands for compliance with claims involving security animal welfare pollution control and sustainability of natural resources and human societies (Elkington 1999). Examples of these fields include products derived from genetically modified organisms (GMOs)e). Borit) jorge.santos@uit.no(Schiermeier 2004) human stem cell lines (Darnovsky and Fogel 2007) agricultural (Gebbers and Adamchuk 2010) and seafood products (Smith et al. 2010) timber (Blackburn et al. 2010) hazardous waste (Borit 2014) and toys (Hora et al. 2011). In an attempt to reassure the public that producers' claims regarding quality safety and sustainability among others are met the European Union (EU) has assumed an active role and thoroughly legislated the production of many categories of goods. One common feature of these rules is the use of traceability as a risk management tool for the systematic gathering and recording of information on products and processes. These rules are explicitly designed to facilitate the verification of product or process claims throughout the supply chain. New products such as bioprospecting derivatives (Arnaud-Haond et al. 2011) constantly emerge giving rise to new concerns and demands such as intellectual property rights assurance (Salpin and Germani 2007) biopiracy avoidance and equitable sharing of resources and their benefits (Arrieta et al. 2010). To facilitate the verification of new claims deriving from these new concerns and demands in connection with the production of these new products it is likely that legislators will again M. Borit J. Santos / Journal of Cleaner Production 104 (2015) 13e2214invoke traceability as the remedial process. Recent scandals across the globe that involve traceability are reminders that ambiguities in the definition drivers and legislation involving traceability have serious practical consequences. Most of these scandals involve food products: the presence of horsemeat in Tesco/Findus frozen beef products in Europe (NTB 2013) trade of French horse meat coming from animals used for pharmaceutical purposes (TheMeatSite News Desk 2014) and Wal-Mart (an American retailer) recalling spicy donkeymeat due to traces of fox meat found in the product in China (The Lawyer 2013). Other examples involve non-food products such as the investigations into the labour conditions in overseas factories supplying H&M a European clothing retailer. The conceptual underpinnings of the present work involve the principles of consistency coherence and credibility at the core of law. Consistency coherence and credibility rank high in the EU legal chart as constitutional principles relevant at the legislative level (Barnard et al. 2013). Consistency is defined as the absence of contradictions whereas coherence refers to positive connections (Barnard et al. 2013) and credibility means that rules are clear and predictable (European Commission 2014). At a general level the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union stipulates that the EU shall ensure consistency between its policies and activities (European Commission 2012a). Such a consistency provides coherence and credibility to the respective body of law. The main purpose of this study is to assess whether EU traceability legislation (i.e. the technical wording of the legal text) is consistent with the declared objective of the law (i.e. to implement a traceability system throughout the entire product supply chain). The focus is on the words of the legislation and not on general policy arguments. It is important to perform such an analysis of the legal text because the legislature sets minimum compliance requirements that businesses will have to follow. If the legal text is flawed traceability systems put up by less aware businesses can be ineffective and supply chains may thus become vulnerable to opportunistic behaviour as exemplified by those recent cases indicated above. Concurrently consumers are likely to be confused and question their trust in a legislature that creates risk regarding different product claims (quality safety etc.) by using the notion of traceability inconsistently. In addition this study attempts to explain the inconsistencies observed in the rules. This explanation is made after examining several potentially influential factors such as the type of product drivers for the traceability regulation of a product and its trade value. While focussing on the EU this interdisciplinary study is relevant worldwide because EU traceability legislation has direct consequences on the legal systems of the countries that the EU trades with. Moreover this study is influential across all sectors that use product traceability as a risk management tool and provides an in-depth understanding of these industrial sectors in connectionwith the legislative understanding. This paper advances the scientific understanding of major issues in the area such as what traceability is how it is achieved through legislation why laws addressing the same concepts do not follow the same traceability principles and how legal consistency can be achieved in a legislated domain. In Section 2 certain major issues in this field such as controversial perceptions about the meaning of traceability and the connection between traceability and verification of data are clarified. The methodology used in the analysis of the consistency of legal norms is explained in Section 3. Empirical results of the analysis of 30 EU regulations and directives covering 16 general categories of products are presented in Section 4. Implications for the present and future applicability of traceability regulations are discussed in Section 5 before conclusions are drawn in Section 6.2. Conceptualisation of product traceability In the last two decades traceability has become a popular concept in industrial logistics (Opara 2003) regardless of the production regime and type of product (Flapper et al. 2002; Jansen-Vullers et al. 2003). Nevertheless tackling the theoretical aspects of traceability seems to be difficult. In some supply chains such as those in the food industry the disputes begin with the definition of traceability. Different branches of the food industry have different perceptions about the meaning of traceability despite common requirements and drivers that generally extend across industries (Jansen-Vullers et al. 2003). Thus many researchers simply do not mention any definition of traceability in their articles refer to at least two meanings of it or make up their own definition (Olsen and Borit 2013). A typical misconception of laypeople and many authors (for examples see Olsen and Borit 2013) is that traceability is only a numeric code attached to products that it actually means place of origin or that it is a method to ensure that information about the product is true. The professional controversy continues with the granularity and the depth of traceability e how small should the identified unit be (e.g. a crate of shrimps or one-month production of beef lasagne) and whether the entire supply chain (i.e. from field/farm/hook to plate) or only parts of the supply chain should be covered by traceability requirements and whether this coverage should be based on risk assessment (e.g. steps in production in which pathogens are inactivated). Other points of disagreement include the breadth of traceability i.e. the amount of information the system records (McEntire et al. 2010) and the body that should be responsible for implementing traceability i.e. the legislature or the industry. In conclusion traceability has been both a politically and strategically controversial issue and has acted as a major deterrent for multidisciplinary cooperation and understanding (Vorst 2004). On a deeper level the multiple perceptions about the meaning and applicability of traceability held by different people may be related to idiosyncratic cultural backgrounds and therefore to their basic notions of trust and transparency requirements (Hofstede 2004). Following this suggestion it has been noted that transparency does not equate to traceability (Egels-Zanden et al. 2014) because the latter only sets the framework for the former. Considering that the market for technologies related to food traceability alone will reach USD 10.6 billion in 2014 (Visiongain 2013) a clear understanding of how traceability is employed in different contexts is important for the public in general for industries in the EU and for these industries' suppliers overseas. The present work uses the definition from ISO 8402/1994 (ISO1994) as this is the definition of traceability that incorporates all the critical properties of a traceability system as described in the scientific literature (Olsen and Borit 2013). Thus traceability of any given product refers to �the ability to trace the origin of materials and parts the product processing history and the distribution and location of the product after delivery by means of recorded identifications� (Olsen and Borit 2013). There are several principles (or requirements) that must be followed for the traceability system to be effective. It is critical that these recordings are interconnected and in a format that allows the product to be tracked along the entire supply chain. Thus units that are traced (traceable resource units (TRUs) e.g. a timber log a box of mackerel one day's production of shampoo) and identification/numbering schemes that provide codes/numbers used for the unique identification of TRUs (e.g. GS1 barcodes) are parts of a traceability system (Borit and Olsen 2012). For this system to be effective it is essential that the codes of a TRU (either as a raw material or semi-finished product) entering a link in the supply chain are associated uniquely with those of the same item (semi-finished or end M. Borit J. Santos / Journal of Cleaner Production 104 (2015) 13e22 15product) leaving the link. This ability to identify products individually is the basis of product traceability (Jansen-Vullers et al. 2003; Kelepouris et al. 2007; Moe 1998; Poli 2004; Porter et al. 2011). Equally critical is maintaining accurate records of the transformations (e.g. splitting joining) that the TRU undergoes and sharing the TRU identification code with partners in the supply chain (Kelepouris et al. 2007; Nachay 2011). The definition used herein relates to all types of products and services and is believed to provide the basis for effective traceability (Olsen and Borit 2013). With respect to the food sector this approach concurs with the position recently taken in the USA the largest single food importer/exporter in the world by the Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) in its new Food Safety Modernization Act (Nachay 2011). Based on these arguments this study maintains that traceability is an infrastructure that can be used by control agencies for two purposes. The first purpose is to retrieve different data for various reasons (such as validation of documentation of environmental sustainability e e.g. food miles emissions (Olsen 2009) e or contamination concerns). The second purpose is to verify these data with their specific means e including genetic identification of species such as in the seafood mislabelling cases identified by studies such as those reported in Helyar et al. 2014 (haddock labelled as cod; tilapia sushi labelled as white tuna sushi). Mislabelling in these cases �presents substantial challenges for the sustainable management of the respective fisheries� (Helyar et al. 2014). As discussed in the literature �a traceability system is quite similar to a filing cabinet in that they both deal with systematic storing and retrieving of data. Importantly neither a traceability system nor a filing cabinet care about what types of data are being stored� (Olsen and Borit 2013). This notion has several important consequences. For instance there is no guarantee that the recordings are true or complete as both error and fraud can lead to false claims about the properties of the food product including its origin. There is a clear need to verify these claims and in this area analytical methods and instruments play a crucial role. Similarly documenting traceability and documenting eco-label type chain of custody are two different concepts. Although traceability can be used as a tool in the certification process traceability and certification are nonetheless different processes (Borit and Olsen 2012). 3. Methods and data The aim of this study is to analyse first whether the EU body of law addressing product traceability is consistently applying traceability requirements. Second this study attempts to offer an explanation of the situation at hand and forecast future legal approaches to product traceability. To address the complexity of these research aims this study employed a mixed methodological approach that involved four steps: 1) a systematic review of EU regulations and directives that refer to product traceability; 2) codification and interpretation of these laws according to traceability criteria adapted from Borit and Olsen (2012) and based on logical operations; 3) statistical analyses to reveal possible associations between the drivers categories and trade value of products and the traceability approach chosen by the legislature; and 4) a forecast of the traceability approach taken by the EU legislators for several new products. 3.1. Systematic legislation review This study was undertaken as a systematic literature review based on the original guidelines proposed by specialty literature (Booth et al. 2012; Kitchenham 2004; Machi and McEvoy 2009). The steps in the systematic literature review method aredocumented below. To identify the EU legislation that refers to product traceability a two-steps search strategy was implemented as follows. The on-line search looked for �traceability� in �title� and afterwards in �title AND text� in the EUR-Lex database (the EU database of EU law). All documents found in the first online search were included in a preliminary list. Only the most recent documents viz. the first 100 hits (ordered by date) returned in the second search were added to this list. Inclusion and exclusion criteria for the final list were formulated as follows. Inclusion criteria were that the norms were published as a regulation or directive in the Official Journal of the European Communities and that they referred to traceability of products defined as the result of activities or processes (ISO 1994). Exclusion criteria were that the norms were published in the Official Journal of the European Communities as something other than as a regulation or directive and referred to other types of traceability (e.g. traceability in software systems or measurement traceability). After eliminating documents that failed to meet these criteria 16 legal rules remained for analysis. Norms implementing or amending these rules were identified and were added to the final list of documents if they fulfilled the inclusion criteria. A summary of the legislation included in the final list is given in Table 1. These 30 rules covered the following 16 groups of products: toys timber and timber products seal products (i.e. all products derived or obtained from all species of pinnipeds) food in general fish and fish products sourced inside and outside the EU beef eggs food and feed products produced from GMOs organic products explosives for civil uses cosmetics medicinal products hazardous waste human blood and blood components and human tissues and cells. The English language version of these documents was used for analysis. The coding and interpretation procedures are detailed in Section 3.2. 3.2. Codification and interpretation based on logical operations To analyse the consistency of these legal rules this study utilised a coding scheme based on a generalised and simplified version of the evaluation framework for effective traceability systems described by Borit and Olsen (2012). Because this framework was originally developed for analysing legal norms in a different and specific context (i.e. addressing illegal unreported and unregulated known as IUU fishing) it was generalised by transforming the IUU-critical traceability control points into the common links of a product supply chain (i.e. supply manufacture storage transport etc.). Only those descriptors related to effective traceability were considered i.e. those that required that 1) TRUs were uniquely identified such that they might be individually traced along the supply chain; 2) special measures were in place at each link of the supply chain to assure the identification of suppliers and customers of products; 3) for TRUs whose integrity can be affected under product processing such as food whether records of transformations (e.g. splitting or joining) were kept was also checked; and 4) the traceability provisions covered the entire supply chain. Onematrix was developed for each of the 16 products and included the coding for all the legal norms regulating the respective supply chain. The provisions of the legal text were read thoroughly and coded in the respective cells of the evaluation matrix by one rater. At this step the specific requirements of the rules rather than general and imprecise requirements were considered. While coding the legal text the rater followed both the literal and purposive approaches to statutory interpretation of the EU legislation as directed by the literature (R�osler 2012) and reported the same results regardless of the approach. During coding the stated drivers for traceability for each product were also identified. In addition the products were divided into four categories based on the Table 1 Summary of documents used to evaluate the EU legislative approach to traceability in the case of 16 groups of products.

Santos / Journal of Cleaner Production 104 (2015) 13e2216research and development (R&D) intensities of their manufacturing industries as defined by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) (OECD Directorate for Science 2011) as shown in Table 2. The identification of TRUs was straightforward for most product chains except for the toy industry. In this special case the rules identified the toy prototype e rather than the production or trade units e because the TRU warranted the identification number. It is beyond the scope of this analysis to decide whether this is appropriate; for purposes of simplicity it was considered that the first principle of traceability was fulfilled. The scoring of individual entries in the matrices e as well as the logical operations performed with these scores e can be explained in terms of three-valued logic (Breuer 1972). An individual entry in the matrix could only take one of three possible values {0? 1}Table 2 Products and their respective driver for traceability stated in the legal norms (some prod 16th group of products with pollution control as the traceability driver. Driver for traceability Categories of products P Natural resource sustainability or animal welfare Low-technology F p Product quality Low-technology F High-technology H Human safety or security Low-technology B Medium-low-technology T Medium-high-technology E High-technology M p depending respectively on whether the requirement was absent (false proposition) equivocal (fuzzy proposition) or clearly defined and addressed (true proposition). Logical operations occur when calculating the final value of supply chain coverage or traceability (e.g. requirement C) from two or more requirements (e.g. A and B). In this qualitative characterisation the value of the requirement C for the supply chain (horizontal analysis) and traceability (vertical analysis) was the result of the logical conjunction operation i.e. A ^ B. Thus in the final assessment the results of this logical operation can only take three values: true (1) if present in all requirements false (0) if absent in any requirement and equivocal (?) in all other cases. This calculation method rendered traceability true (effective) in eight cases and false (non-effective) in the remaining eight. To further distinguish partly effective traceability (i.e. traceability that allows for a system that would function to a limited extent) fromucts have two drivers). Hazardous waste (not included in the OECD taxonomy) is the roducts ish and fish products sourced outside and outside the EU; timber and timber roducts; seal products. ood; organic products. uman blood and blood components; human tissues and cells. eef; egg; food. oys. xplosives for civil uses; cosmetics. edicinal products; human blood and blood components; food and feed products roduced from genetically modified organisms; human tissues and cells. M. Borit J. Santos / Journal of Cleaner Production 104 (2015) 13e22 17the non-effective themajority functionwas chosen to be used in all the false cases. Thus traceability was set to false only when n/2 arguments or more were false where n is the number of traceability conditions (Valiant 1984) and to partly effective in all other cases. 3.3. Statistical analysis and forecast The statistical analyses employed in this study explored whether the approaches to traceability identified by this research of EU legislation were correlated with the trade value with the driver for legislation or with inclusion into a certain category of products. To measure these associations Spearman's rho was used. This non-parametric descriptor was considered most appropriate for measuring the concordance between sets of observations that were qualitative and ordinal in nature. The tests were performed in the statistical package SPPS 19.0 with a significance level a � 0.05 (two tailed) for rejecting the null hypothesis of no relationship between sets of descriptive variables. The first analysis investigated the association between the stated drivers of the EU regulations and the effectiveness of the traceability systems introduced in 16 supply chains. Prior to statistical inference the traceability approach followed by the EU legislators was coded in numerals as follows: 1 e for norms in which the traceability value was assessed to be non-effective (false); 2 e when the traceability value was evaluated as partly effective; and 3 e when the traceability value was assessed to be effective (true). The drivers for traceability were coded in numerals according to a scale that implicitly contrasted concern for nature with consumer satisfaction and particularly human health and safety: 1 e the main driver was natural resource sustainability or animal welfare; 2 e the main driver was product quality (including organic claims); 3 e the main driver was the safety or security of humans. The second analysis investigated whether the approach to traceability taken by the EU legislators was somehow related to the regulated category of product. The final analysis investigated whether there is a relationship between the trade value of the products and the traceability approach of the EU legislature. The sources used to extract trade data are listed in Table 3. The hazardous waste group was omitted from the last two analyses because this group is absent from the OECD taxonomy and misses trade values. After finalising these statistical analyses the forecast by analogy method (Green and Armstrong 2007) was used to predict the traceability approach taken by EU legislators for several new products. These are products in connection with which the requirement for traceability has been raised either by lawmakers or academics or they are goods otherwise judged by the authors of this study as being of future interest to legislators: textiles aquaculture feed of wild origin non-hazardous waste from offshore oil production waste from electrical and electronic equipment and products derived frommarine bioprospecting activities (other than medicinal products). 4. Empirical results The main result of the analysis is that EU product traceability legislation is inconsistent in the application of traceability requirements. As detailed in Table 3 in all the legal rules except those applying to products derived from seals (marine mammals) the traceability provisions were explicitly devised to cover the entire supply chain of goods. However only with respect to eight groups of products does the legislation correctly follow the traceability principles and provide for an effective system that is a system that enables the identification of the origin of the product and of itsinput materials in addition to conducting full backward and forward tracking to determine its specific location and life history in the supply chain (Olsen and Borit 2013). Thus all manufacturers in high-technology industries (food and feed products produced from GMOs; medicinal products; blood and blood components; and tissues and cells) one each in medium-high- technology and medium-low-technology (explosives and toys) and some in lowtechnology (beef eggs) enterprises must employ appropriate systems and standardised procedures to identify suppliers and customers (i.e. neighbouring operators) and to record the transformations that the TRUs undergo. In addition the TRUs related to all these products must be assigned unique identifiers. The documents with which the EUmade the traceability allegation in connection with these products are listed in Table 3 together with the specific drivers for traceability mentioned in the legal norms. In contrast with the first group of products some goods among the remaining eight supply chains i.e. cosmetics and organic products meet the principles of mandatory identification of neighbour economic operatorse and in the latter case of recording transformationse but lack unique identification of TRUs. Thus they were considered to be only partly effective. In the remaining groups of products traceability was deemed to be not effective due to caveats in the following items: 1) identification systems for neighbour operators (seal products hazardous waste); 2) mandatory recording of transformations (timber and timber products fish and fish products sourced both inside and outside the EU general food products hazardous waste); and 3) unique identification of TRUs (all cases). The ambiguous commitment to the basic principles of traceability clearly contrasts with the resolve shown by legislators in the eight cases in which the necessary conditions were explicitly demanded. This demonstrated an inconsistent approach to the same matter. Trying to find an explanation for this situation a strong positive correlation between the driver for riskmanagement in the legal norms and the effectiveness of the chosen traceability approach was detected (see Table 4). When the main driver for implementing traceability relates to or can impact on human health e as opposed to product quality or environmental sustainability e legislation normally imposes effective traceability systems (see Fig. 1). In addition a moderate positive correlation was found between the category of products and the traceability approach. Goods manufactured by the hightechnology industry are more likely to comply with all conditions for effective traceability. However no correlation was found between the trade value of different products and the approach to traceability adopted by the legislature. EU regulations apparently follow traditional ethical lines. Legislation requires effective traceability mostly when human health e rather than commercial environmental or intangible issues e are at stake. These discrimination rules enable the forecasting of the effectiveness of norms that are being developed now or are likely to be initiated in the future (Table 5). Thus it is expected that the traceability systems imposed for products manufactured in lowtechnology industries such as textiles (EU 2011) or aquaculture feed of wild origin (Naylor et al. 2009) will fall short of effectiveness. The drivers for monitoring these products relate to product quality and nature sustainability. With pollution reduction as a driver but addressing medium-technology products the traceability systems for the waste of electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE TRACE Project 2012) and of offshore nonhazardous oil production waste (Borit 2014) will likely only be partly effective. This might also be the case for high-technology products based on marine bioprospecting activities when the Table 3 Analysis results of the EU legislative approach to traceability: no highlight indicates legal norms that implement effective (true) traceability systems; light grey highlighted cells indicate the laws that implement a partly effective traceability system; dark grey highlighted cells indicate the rules that implement a non-effective (false) traceability system.

Discussion The traceability system applied by operators in the market does not need to be as loose as inferred from the benchmarking of the regulations performed here. In the absence of clear legal norms some supply chains such as specific segments of the food industry assumedmore responsibility and began to rely on private standards (e.g. ISO 22000 Bureau Veritas Certification) that include traceability provisions that are effective but only partially measurable (Olsen 2009). However this might not be always the case even in sectors that may be perceived by the public as tightly controlled such as the food sector in the EU: after the beef-horsemeat scandal in Europe agricultural experts declared that �the lack of transparency and traceability is flagrant in regard to poultry pork and horsemeat� (Priscille 2013). It has been noted that the mislabelled beef was traced back to its original supplier due to the effective traceability implemented in the beef sector (i.e. the one who fraudulently or accidentally mislabelled the horsemeat as beef). Nevertheless because of the non-effective traceability of the horsemeat sector the origin of this meat could not be identified (Priscille 2013). The difficulties in following the horsemeat through its supply chain raised questions about the human health risk encountered by consumption of meat that might be improper for humans. Thus why does the legislature or different uncoordinated legislatures working under different contexts make demands that are sufficiently specific for some goods but not for others thus neglecting the principle of the consistency of laws? As indicated by the results of this study the driver(s) for traceability and the category of products exert an important influence on this approach. Getting traceability principles right in the case of the eight faulty product categories and in new legislation such as the legislativeFig. 1. Environmental concerns have little leverage in traceability norms. The data points represent only legislation for the groups of products manufactured in low-to high-technology industries included in the OECD taxonomy (OECD 2011).package proposed by the EU in 2013 in connection with product safety and market surveillance (European Commission 2013a) is not a difficult task. Excellent examples of norms for complex supply systems have previously been implemented in the EU as described above. Operational implementation of effective traceability is however chain specific. A general recommendation to the legislature is to keep track of the traceability principles: assignment of a unique identification number to each defined TRU; assurance that systems allowing the identification of neighbour operators are in place; specifications for the recording of transformations that must be performed at each production stage; and assurance that these rules cover the entire supply chain. When guided by appropriate legislation it will be the prerogative of the industry to implement adequate technical solutions for the specific production chain and driver for traceability. With respect to the food industry practitioners claim that there are already technical solutions available to implement effective traceability in most supply chains (conform. Petter Olsen senior scientist Nofima Norway). Moreover the labelling industry considers that �legislation on traceability in pharmaceuticals maywell be applied to foods sooner rather than later� (Smithers Pira 2014). Nonetheless the future of truly effective traceability in some sectors particularly those outside the health business (i.e. in all areas except cosmetics) is unclear. Some people working with traceability worry that the cost of implementing an effective systemmay lead operators to look for ways to avoid the rules. Others including some European politicians (GUENGL 2013) argue that legislators have a responsibility to make any criminal act as difficult as possible. It is notable that even this view may have critics among the regulators. Some of these regulators clearly disapprove of the implementation of effective traceability on the grounds that the complexity of the matter may escape both academics and the industry (conform Jean-Pierre Vergine Directorate-General for Maritime Affairs and Fisheries EU during the Seafood Summit 2010 (Seafood Choices Alliance 2010)). In the end it is only possible to predict that future safety and environmental scandals will lead authorities to be explicit and consistent about what type of product tracking systems are politically acceptable or feasible under cost/benefit analyses. However there is another question that arises: how important is it that traceability legislation passes the effectiveness test? The inconsistency and ambiguity in applying traceability principles can have critical consequences for risk management and for consumer support. While a traceability system alone cannot for instance deter the infiltration of illegally harvested wild resources into the supply chain or the mislabelling of products it can facilitate secondary actions that do so if supported by proper data recording requirements. These actions include identification of perpetrators assignment of liability and elimination of offending products from the market thereby leading to loss of profit for non-compliant actors. Moreover getting traceability right would provide other far-reaching advantages such as settling commercial disputes (e.g. the case of the EU seal products ban brought to the World Trade Organization (COWI 2010)) and providing a framework for improved transparency as requested by academia (Weil et al. 2013) and consumers (Lye 2011). More importantly data obtained with the help of such a traceability system would facilitate Table 5 Forecast of traceability approach of the EU legislator based on its correlation with traceability drivers and the category of products. Product Who mentioned traceability in connection with this product? Driver(s) Category of products What kind of traceability system will the future the EU legislation implement? forecast made by this study: Textiles EU; Article 24 Regulation 1007/ 2011 Correct and uniform information for consumers Low-technology Non-effective Aquaculture feed of wild origin Academia (Weil et al. 2013) Sustainability of natural resources Low-technology Non-effective Non-hazardous wastes from offshore oil production (Borit 2014) Likely future development in our opinion Pollution reduction Correct and uniform information for consumers Medium-lowtechnology Partly effective Wastes from electrical and electronic equipment WEEE TRACE Project (WEEE TRACE Project 2012) Pollution reduction Medium-hightechnology Partly effective Products based on marine bioprospecting activities other than medicinal products Likely future development in our opinion IPR biopiracy equitable sharing of resources and benefits from resources High-technology Partly effective M. Borit J. Santos / Journal of Cleaner Production 104 (2015) 13e2220both performing product life cycle analysis (Bellon-Maurel et al. 2014) and providing a complete type III environmental declaration for any product. Such declarations are documents used to communicate environmental claims (European Commission 2013b; International EPD� System 2013) where life cycle analysis is the method used to quantify the environmental impact of any product (Bellon-Maurel et al. 2014; Lehuger et al. 2009; Stilgoe et al. 2014). However the mere naming of non-effective systems as traceability may give both the legislature and consumers a false sense of security and hinder further action research and effective new legislation in the field. Finally public trust can be eroded if it becomes public knowledge that claims made regarding goods sold some at premium prices cannot be established with reasonable certainty. There are solutions simpler than traceability for partial product tracking such as when the regulator only requires operators to identify their suppliers or customers. This process is less efficient and more inaccurate because tracing product sources can only be attempted by means of a formal and often lengthy examination of each link in the chain. To clarify it is appropriate to employ terms such as step-by-step or chain traceability instead of the comprehensive name of traceability. The principle of the correct denomination of traceability systems should also be complied with by certification and documentation schemes which are also becoming increasingly common among private actors (Nilsson et al. 2004). These requirements for correct denomination of procedures also involve the responsibility to inform producers and consumers of the concepts applied and their limitations. 6. Conclusions Following several serious threats to consumer safety posed by food and other products the risk of contamination from infections in blood transfusions or the threats to environmental sustainability posed by illegal fishing the EU chose traceability as a mandatory risk management tool for different supply chains. Considering that such issues are too critical to be left to the disposition of industry alone specific legislation was passed for implementing traceability in the supply chain of different products manufactured in low-to high-technology industries. Among these legal norms 30 directives and regulations seeking to establish strict monitoring requirements for 16 groups of products were identified. The analysis shows that the application of traceability principles is inconsistent. With respect to eight groups of products the legislation correctly follows traceability principles and provides an effective system. Thus the traceability legislation in high-technology industries (food and feed products produced from GMOs medicinal productsblood and blood components and tissues and cells) one each in medium-high-technology and medium-low-technology (explosives and toys respectively) and some in low-technology (beef eggs) follows all the traceability principles. However the traceability legislation applicable to the remaining product groups (cosmetics organic products seal products hazardous waste timber and timber products fish and fish products sourced both inside and outside the EU and general food products) fails to do so. To provide awider picture of the true effectiveness of traceability in the EU this theoretical analysis should be complemented by an evaluation of the practical performance of traceability in the various industries identified here. Several steps can be taken to improve the consistency of the laws. These steps require that legislators always formulate the legal text by following the principles of traceability closely: assignment of a unique identification number to each defined TRU; assurance that systems allowing the identification of neighbour operators are in place; specifications for the recording of transformations that must be performed at each production stage; and assurance that these rules cover the entire supply chain. Such clear legal text will facilitate effective implementation of traceability which in turn will enable other processes such as product life cycle analyses identification of illegal traders product recall and others. This paper advances the scientific understanding of major issues in the area such as what traceability is how it is achieved through legislation why laws addressing the same concepts do not follow the same traceability principles in a similar manner and how legal consistency in the legislated domain can be achieved.Acknowledgements We thank Jean Aase Cornel Borit Hans Jacob Bull Nicolas Lockhart and Lodve A.

Funded	by	the	Government	of	Japan	the	project	aims	to	strengthen	global	capacity	for	implementation	 of	the	FAO	Code	of	Conduct	for	Responsible	Fisheries.		 As	a	preliminary	step	of	this	project	the	taskforce	of	the	�Traceability	of	Fisheries	Products�	subcomponent	commissioned	a	series	of	country	studies	in	order	to	examine	common	practices	in	the	 implementation	of	traceability	in	10	countries.	 The	main	objectives	of	this	present	study	are	�to	review	the	10	national	traceability	case	studies	taking	 into	account	their	relevance	for	combatting	IUU	fishing�	and	�to	provide	recommendations	on	ways	to	 improve	their	traceability	practices	especially	to	combat	IUU	fishing�.		 Furthermore	it	was	requested	that	the	authors	include	the	food	safety	component	associated	to	 traceability.	Hence	and	due	to	the	limitations	of	the	analysis	the	study	focuses	only	on	sanitary	 eligibility	involving	the	traceability	system	associated	to	the	unique	identification	in	terms	of	control	of	 sanitary	and	operational	conditions	that	the	production	chain	of	seafood	in	a	country	is	required	to	 comply	with	and	is	therefore	controlled	and	verified	by	a	suitable	Competent	Authority	(CA).	 The	authors�	activities	took	place	under	the	following	strategy	agreed	with	the	project	coordinators.	 Based	on	the	provided	secondary	sources	(i.e.	the	10	reports)	the	authors	assessed	the	following	 aspects:	 1)	if	the	state	has	a	functional	traceability	system;	 2)	if	this	system	is	suitable	for	fish	products	traceability;	 3)	if	this	traceability	system	is	designed	as	to	optimize	combatting	IUU	fishing	under	two	components:	 3.a)	if	the	data	captured	by	the	system	are	relevant	for	identification	of	IUU	fishing;	 3.b)	if	the	traceability	system	covers	all	the	points	in	the	distribution	chain	relevant	for	IUU	 fishing.	 4)	if	this	traceability	system	is	designed	as	to	optimize	official	sanitary	eligibility	of	all	the	value	chain	 from	harvest	onwards.	 For	Point	1	recommendations	found	in	scientific	literature	for	assessment	of	effective	traceability	 systems	were	followed.		 For	Point	2	the	recommendations	of	the	ISO	standard	12875:2011	Traceability	of	finfish	products	-	 Specification	on	the	information	to	be	recorded	in	captured	finfish	distribution	chains	were	followed.	As	 the	name	indicates	this	one	refers	only	to	finfish	so	shellfish	are	not	included	but	it	is	assumed	that	 the	results	can	be	extrapolated	to	shellfish	as	well.	 For	Point	3	there	is	no	standard	addressing	this	issue	yet	and	only	one	scholarly	article	could	be	found	 on	the	topic	(Borit	&	Olsen	2012).	Thus	the	argument	in	this	article	for	both	point�s	3.a	and	3.b.	were	 followed	by	making	a	simplified	version	of	the	referenced	decision	matrix.		 Based	on	this	analysis	the	authors	evaluated	the	country	reports	traceability	systems	in	terms	of	there:	 a. Inclusivity	-	the	extent	to	which	the	system	is	designed	to	provide	guarantees	for	all	legally-caught	 and	sanitary	controlled	fish	in	the	value	chain	of	the	species/fishery	in	question;		 b. Impermeability	-	the	extent	to	which	the	system	is	designed	to	exclude	illegal	catches	and	potential	 non-controlled	processing	practices;	and		 c. Verifiability-	the	extent	to	which	the	system	is	audited	by	an	independent	body	or	person	(i.e.	by	 those	other	than	the	parties	directly	responsible	for	following	the	requirements).	 Prior	to	the	country	analysis	the	authors	considered	important	to	standardize	the	understanding	of	 traceability	and	other	concepts	relevant	to	the	present	study	based	on	the	relevant	bibliography	known	 to	them	as	this	would	be	the	only	way	to	evaluate	all	the	country	studies	under	the	same	 	 	 7	 methodology.	 After	the	analysis	of	the	individual	reports	it	was	found	that	none	of	the	sources	provided	enough	 information	to	assess	whether	the	principles	of	effective	traceability	were	met	by	the	traceability	 systems	of	the	10	respective	countries.	 Common	issues	identified	throughout	some	of	the	reports	were	in	regards	the	expectations	of	ToR�s;	 the	relevance	for	combating	IUU	Fishing	ensuring	Food	Safety	and	Sanitary	Eligibility	reducing	 vulnerability	to	threats	and	crisis	(especially	for	small	scale	sector)	and	the	importance	of	the	role�s	held	 by	RFMO�s	and	other	organizations		 Consideration	of	the	results	for	each	country	analysis	the	authors	discussed	the	need	for	 standardization	in	the	methodology	and	tools	required	to	assess	traceability	systems	the	need	for	 coordination	in	between	the	different	authorities	the	roles	of	external	and	internal	traceability	the	 incorporation	of	information	management	systems	and	the	need	of	standardization	in	the	domain	 language	of	traceability.	 The	study	concludes	that	the	systematic	review	of	the	10	country	reports	shows	that	there	is	a	lot	of	 confusion	and	inconsistencies	in	the	meaning	scope	legal	status	implementation	capacity	and	control	 of	traceability	systems.	 The	authors	believe	that	FAO	as	in	other	aspects	of	fisheries	and	seafood	production	it	is	in	a	unique	 position	to	lead	this	efforts	by	expanding	on	the	work	initiated	by	the	�Best	Practice	Guidelines	on	 Traceability�	(COFI:FT	2014)		as	requested	by	the	thirteenth	session	of	the	Sub-Committee	on	Fish	 Trade	(COFI:FT)	in	Bergen	Norway	24�28	February	2014.	 The	authors	support	the	proposition	that	FAO	should	convene	an	expert	consultation	which	would	 benefit	from	the	findings	of	this	present	study	and	include	international	experts	on	traceability	from	all	 geographical	regions	as	well	as	representatives	of	the	various	stakeholders	along	the	seafood	supply	 chain	to	provide	not	only	a	set	of	guidelines	on	how	to	implement	traceability	systems	but	equally	 importantly	how	to	evaluate	them.	 The	report	concludes	with	a	set	of	overarching	recommendations	to	FAO	and	to	the	group	of	countries	 whose	reports	were	evaluated.		 	 	 	 8	 2 Background	of	the	consultancy	 The	Food	and	Agriculture	Organisation	of	the	United	Nations	(FAO)	is	the	implementing	agency	for	the	 �Fisheries	Management	and	Marine	Conservation	within	a	Changing	Ecosystem	Context�	project.	 Funded	by	the	Government	of	Japan	the	project	aims	to	strengthen	global	capacity	for	implementation	 of	the	FAO	Code	of	Conduct	for	Responsible	Fisheries.	As	a	preliminary	step	of	this	project	the	taskforce	 of	the	�Traceability	of	Fisheries	Products�	sub-component	commissioned	a	series	of	country	studies	in	 order	to	examine	common	practices	in	the	implementation	of	traceability	in	10	countries:	Argentina	 Barbados	Morocco	Peru	Senegal	Sri-Lanka	Tanzania	Turkey	Uganda	and	Vietnam.	The	studies	on	 national	traceability	practices	(including	regulations	and	implementation)	in	these	10	countries	are	to	 conform	the	backbone	of	this	report.	 The	terms	of	reference	(ToRs)	for	the	present	study	included:	 1. The	consultant	will	undertake	the	following	actions	in	relation	to	10	national	case	studies	on	 traceability	practices:	Argentina	Barbados	Morocco	Peru	Senegal	Sri-Lanka	Tanzania	Turkey	 Uganda	and	Vietnam	(GCP/INT/253/JPN).	 2. Review	the	national	traceability	case	studies	in	function	of	their:	 a. Inclusivity	-	the	extent	to	which	the	system	is	designed	to	provide	guarantees	for	all	legallycaught	fish	in	the	value	chain	of	the	species/fishery	in	question;		 b. Impermeability	-	the	extent	to	which	the	system	is	designed	to	exclude	illegal	catches	and	 potential	non-controlled	processing	practices;	and		 c. Verifiability-	the	extent	to	which	the	system	is	audited	by	those	other	than	the	parties	 directly	responsible	for	following	the	requirements.	 3. Take	into	account	relevance	for	combatting	IUU	fishing	insuring	food	safety	and	reducing	 vulnerability	to	threats	and	crises	especially	for	small	scale	sector	and	legal	fisheries.		 4. Perform	a	comparison	of	the	different	case	studies	identifying	best	practices	including	a	SWOT	 analysis.	 5. Include	a	brief	status	report	on	the	role	of	regional	bodies	(RFMOs)	in	development	and	 implementation	of	traceability	practices	in	the	above	countries	whenever	relevant.	 6. Prepare	a	Final	Summary	Report	with	conclusions	on	common	national	practices/best	practices	 identified	in	the	case	studies.	Note	any	regional	differences/similarities	implications	for	small-scale	 sector	versus	commercial	operations	and	major	challenges	to	improve	seafood	sustainability	in	the	 10	case	studies.			 7. Provide	concrete	expert	recommendations	to	national	policymakers	on	improved	national/regional	 policies.	Provide	FAO	with	recommendations	on	ways	to	assist	national	governments	to	improve	 their	traceability	practices	especially	to	combat	IUU	fishing	and	improve	resilience	along	the	 seafood	value	chain	to	support	sustainable	livelihoods.	 3 Strategy	 3.1 Authors�	approach	 The	authors�	activities	took	place	under	the	following	strategy	agreed	a	priori	with	the	project	 coordinators.	 The	main	objectives	of	this	study	are	�to	review	the	national	traceability	case	studies	taking	into	 account	their	relevance	for	combatting	IUU	fishing�	and	�to	provide	recommendations	on	ways	to	 improve	their	traceability	practices	especially	to	combat	IUU	fishing�.		 Furthermore	it	was	requested	that	the	authors	include	the	food	safety	component	associated	to	 traceability.	Hence	and	due	to	the	limitations	of	the	analysis	the	study	focuses	only	on	sanitary	 	 	 9	 eligibility	involving	the	traceability	system	associated	to	the	unique	identification	in	terms	of	control	of	 sanitary	and	operational	conditions	that	the	production	chain	of	seafood	in	a	country	is	required	to	 comply	with	and	is	therefore	controlled	and	verified	by	a	suitable	Competent	Authority.	 Therefore	having	as	data	source	the	countries	reports	this	study	assessed	the	following	aspects:	 1)	if	the	respective	state	has	implemented	a	functional	traceability	system;	 2)	if	this	system	is	suitable	for	fish	products	traceability;	 3)	if	this	traceability	system	is	designed	as	to	optimize	combatting	IUU	fishing	under	two	components:	 3.a)	if	the	data	captured	by	the	system	are	relevant	for	identification	of	IUU	fishing;	 3.b)	if	the	traceability	system	covers	all	the	points	in	the	distribution	chain	relevant	for	IUU	 fishing.	 4)	if	this	traceability	system	is	designed	as	to	optimize	official	sanitary	eligibility	of	all	the	value	chain	 from	harvest	onwards.	 For	Point	1	recommendations	found	in	scientific	literature	for	assessment	of	effective	traceability	 systems	were	followed.		 For	Point	2	the	recommendations	of	the	ISO	standard	12875:2011	Traceability	of	finfish	products	-	 Specification	on	the	information	to	be	recorded	in	captured	finfish	distribution	chains	were	followed.	As	 the	name	indicates	this	one	refers	only	to	finfish	so	shellfish	are	not	included	but	it	is	assumed	that	 the	results	can	be	extrapolated	to	shellfish	as	well.	 For	Point	3	no	standard	addressing	this	issue	was	found.	Thus	this	study	follows	the	argumentation	of	 the	only	one	scholarly	article	identified	on	the	topic	(Borit	&	Olsen	2012)	for	both	point�s	3.a	and	3.b.	 and	using	a	simplified	version	of	the	referenced	decision	matrix.		 Based	on	this	analysis	the	study	provide	recommendations	for	improvement	of	the	respective	 traceability	systems	in	terms	of	their:	 a. Inclusivity	-	the	extent	to	which	the	system	is	designed	to	provide	guarantees	for	all	legally-caught	 and	sanitary	controlled	fish	in	the	value	chain	of	the	species/fishery	in	question;		 b. Impermeability	-	the	extent	to	which	the	system	is	designed	to	exclude	illegal	catches	and	potential	 non-controlled	processing	practices;	and		 c. Verifiability-	the	extent	to	which	the	system	is	audited	by	an	independent	body	or	person	(i.e.	by	 those	other	than	the	parties	directly	responsible	for	following	the	requirements).	 The	authors�	opinion	was	that	due	to	the	lack	of	standardization	and	uniformed	quality	of	the	SWOT	 analysis	provided	in	the	10	reports	their	utility	was	limited	as	to	use	to	perform	an	extra	SWOT	analysis	 of	all	the	reports	furthermore	is	believed	that	the	SWOT	methodology	itself	is	of	limited	use	in	these	 cases.	While	the	process	of	elaborating	a	SWOT	may	enrich	the	knowledge	of	the	authors	of	the	original	 reports	in	the	case	of	this	study	it	does	not	help	in	the	context	of	a	comparative	analysis	hence	the	 authors	did	not	pursue	that	element	of	the	ToR.		 3.2 The	source	reports	 The	source	reports	were	prepared	as	part	of	national	consultancies	for	the	FAO	under	the	project	 �Fisheries	management	and	marine	conservation	within	a	changing	ecosystem	context�	 (GCP/INT/253/JPN).		 The	information	of	each	report	was	compiled	in	order	to	describe	national	traceability	practices	 (including	regulations	and	implementation)	in	the	different	countries	with	respect	to	their	key	fisheries	 and	identify	faced	challenges.		The	main	focus	of	these	reports	was	on	prevention	of	IUU	and	critical	 points	in	the	production	chain	from	point	of	capture	to	final	destination	and	integration	of	practices	for	 IUU	prevention	and	food	safety.		 While	the	terms	of	references	where	standardized	the	resulting	reports	were	far	from	that.	While	some	 reports	did	address	the	issue	most	of	them	read	like	a	disjointed	document	that	collected	information	 	 	 10	 that	did	not	fully	addressed	the	issue	at	hand	and	quoted	various	pieces	of	legislation	not	always	 relevant.	 Most	of	the	countries	are	authorized	to	trade	with	the	European	Union	(EU)	hence	the	traceability	 systems	has	been	developed	through	the	sanitary	or	the	fisheries	side	but	in	most	cases	only	for	the	EU	 destined	production	chain.	 This	initiative	is	the	first	of	its	kind.	In	principle	it	is	consider	to	have	been	a	very	ambitious	undertaking	 as	the	project	hoped	to	find	a	standardization	on	views	on	studies	analysing	different	fishing	universes	 in	terms	of	magnitude	such	as	Peru	in	one	end	and	Barbados	in	the	other	or	regulatory	frameworks	 such	as	Turkey	(a	EU	accession	country)	and	Uganda	(a	landlocked	African	republic).	The	complexity	of	 comparing	such	a	diverse	range	of	countries	made	it	difficult	to	find	a	quantitative	basis	already	 available	hence	the	authors	had	to	develop	their	own.	 3.3 Traceability	as	a	EU	market	access	requirement			 3.3.1 Health	certification	 In	1993	concerns	relating	to	consumer	health	and	safety	led	to	the	establishment	of	hygiene	 regulations	across	the	EU.	These	were	complemented	in	2004	with	regulations	concerning	the	 importation	of	food	and	feed	including	fisheries	and	aquaculture	products.	These	rules	comprised	the	 �hygiene	package�	that	has	evolved	over	time	involving	designated	Competent	Authorities	(CAs)	in	EU	 Member	States	(MS)	and	in	third	countries	a	network	of	Border	Inspection	Posts	(BIPs)	a	system	of	 sanitary	certification	and	of	rapid	alerts	(i.e.	RASFF).	 Traceability	(defined	by	the	EU	in	Regulation	(EC)	no.	178/2002)	is	intrinsically	part	of	the	regulatory	 framework	as	under	the	health	certification	third	countries	have	to	guarantee	that	the	exported	 product	accomplishes	what	is	established	by	the	so-called	EU	�hygiene	package�.		 The	core	of	this	package	is	formed	by	Regulations	(EC)	no.	852/2004	(EC)	no.	853/2004	and	(EC)	no.	 854/2004	which	are	supplemented	by	other	regulations	and	directives.	Third	country	CAs	have	to	 guarantee	that	all	the	participants	in	the	production	chain	from	the	producers	(fishermen	boats	 aquaculture	plants	etc.)	to	the	exporting	establishments	passing	by	cool	stores	processing	 establishments	etc.	comply	with	the	EU	rules.	Thus	it	is	expected	that	all	the	components	of	this	 production	chain	be	identified	with	an	identification	code.	In	other	words	this	identification	code	 assures	that	the	components	of	the	production	chain	having	such	a	code	could	operate	in	the	EU.		 The	exporting	country	CA	needs	to	assure	compliance	with	three	types	of	obligations:	 a) Obligations	of	resources:	i.e.	instruments	of	production	Hazard	Analysis	Critical	Control	Points	 and	prerequisites	programme	traceability	etc.	 b) Obligations	of	results:	i.e.	safety	levels	of	the	product	(e.g.	histamine	contaminants)	etc.	 c) Obligations	of	control:	i.e.	regulatory	verification	data	storage	and	management	legal	support	 etc.	 Once	the	equivalence	is	established	the	country	can	export	to	the	EU	market	as	long	as	the	products	 exported	come	along	with	a	health	certificate	emitted	by	the	CA	of	the	country	of	origin.	 The	EU	through	its	Food	and	Veterinary	Office	(FVO)	reviews	checks	and	makes	sure	that	exporting	 country�s	seafood	safety	regime	is	equivalent	to	that	of	the	EU	itself.	FVO	makes	inspection	missions	to	 third	countries	and	evaluates	the	CAs	performance	as	to	determine	the	status	of	compliance	with	the	 EU	rules.	After	the	inspection	FVO	missions	will	publish	a	public	report	containing	what	they	have	 found	references	and	if	necessary	recommendations	to	facilitate	compliance.		 Regulation	(EC)	no.	854/2004	states	what	kind	of	official	controls	third	countries	CAs	have	to	make	in	 order	to	assure	via	traceability	that	all	production	chain	components	are	respecting	EU	rules.	This	 regulation	establishes	that	the	CA	without	prior	warning	on	a	regular	basis	can	carry	out	official	 controls	with	a	frequency	based	on	risk.	These	controls	can	also	be	done	at	any	stage	of	production	 processing	distribution	exporting	etc.		 	 	 11	 In	other	words	establishments	have	to	be	prepared	to	be	object	of	an	official	control	by	the	CA	at	any	 moment	putting	them	at	risk	of	being	suspended	or	removed	from	the	list	of	official	approved	 establishments	if	they	are	not	able	to	prove	that	are	complying	with	the	EU	hygiene	package	losing	the	 possibility	to	export	to	EU	market	and/or	to	provide	their	product	to	other	establishments	officially	 approved	by	the	CA.	 Besides	the	FVO	the	EU	has	other	tools	to	verify	the	compliance	with	its	rules	by	third	countries.	All	 products	entering	the	EU	coming	from	third	countries	must	entre	via	an	EC	approved	Border	Inspection	 Post	(BIP)	under	the	authority	of	an	official	veterinary.	On	arrival	third	country	products	are	subject	to	 three	types	of	checks:	 a) a	documentary	check:	done	systematically;	 b) an	identity	check:	done	systematically;	 c) a	physical	check:	done	appropriately	to	the	risk	profiling	of	the	consignment.	 If	any	non-compliance	with	the	EU	legislation	is	found	the	BIP	notifies	it	to	the	EU	member	countries	 through	the	RASSF	facilitating	its	detection	on	the	European	Market	thanks	to	the	traceability	system	 that	they	has	to	be	implemented	as	a	result	of	compliance	with	the	hygiene	package.	If	the	product	 represents	a	danger	to	consumers�	health	(e.g.	exceeding	any	regulatory	level	or	containing	nonauthorized	substances)	then	the	exporter	may	decide	if	it	wants	to	recover	it	or	let	it	be	destroyed.	 The	EU	permits	then	only	imports	from	authorised	countries	and	under	each	country	then	there	are	 approved	establishments.		 3.3.2 IUU	catch	certification	 Considering	that	the	EU	consumers	were	concerned	with	the	fact	that		�illegal	unreported	and	 unregulated	(IUU)	fishing	constitutes	one	of	the	most	serious	threats	to	the	sustainable	exploitation	of	 living	aquatic	resources	and	jeopardises	the	very	foundation	of	the	common	fisheries	policy	and	 international	efforts	to	promote	better	ocean	governance�	(preamble	of	the	EU	IUU	Regulation)	the	EU	 adopted	the	Regulation	(EC)	No.	1005/2008	establishing	a	Community	system	to	prevent	deter	and	 eliminate	IUU	fishing	(EU	IUU	Regulation).		This	Regulation	is	accompanied	by	its	respective	 implementing	regulation	and	other	legislative	tools.		 The	EU	IUU	Regulation	prohibits	trade	with	the	Community	in	fishery	products	stemming	from	IUU	 fishing	and	states	in	its	preamble:	��to	make	this	prohibition	effective	and	ensure	that	all	traded	 fishery	products	imported	into	or	exported	from	the	Community	have	been	harvested	in	compliance	with	 international	conservation	and	management	measures	and	where	appropriate	other	relevant	rules	 applying	to	the	fishing	vessel	concerned	a	certification	scheme	applying	to	all	trade	in	fishery	products	 with	the	Community	shall	be	put	in	place.�	 The	Catch	Certification	Scheme	(CCS)	was	introduced	on	the	1st	January	2010	whereby	fisheries	 products1	must	be	accompanied	by	Catch	Certificate	(CC)	declaring	that	the	catch	was	made	in	 accordance	with	applicable	laws	regulations	and	international	conservation	and	management	 measures.	 The	IUU	regulation	applies	to	all	trade	of	marine	fishery	products	processed	or	not	originating	from	 third	country	fishing	vessels	and	exported	to	the	EU	by	any	means	of	transportation.	It	also	applies	to	 any	catches	originating	from	EU	fishing	vessels	to	be	exported	to	third	countries.	Transhipments	and	 processing	operations	are	also	within	the	scope	of	the	IUU	CCS.		 One	of	the	key	aspects	of	this	Regulation	is	the	requirement	of	traceability	of	marine	products.	In	 theory	the	legal	system	aims	to	record	the	origin	of	all	the	marine	products	arriving	to	the	EU	market:		 this	means	knowing	who	captured	the	fish	where	was	it	caught	how	much	was	caught	when	it	was	 																																								 																				 1 		Article	2.8	of	the	EU	IUU	Regulation	defines	the	concept	�fisheries	products�.	This	concept	has	evolved	over	the	years	and	currently	most	of	 the	bivalves	molluscs	and	aquaculture	products	are	excluded	from	the	scope	of	the	EU	IUU	Regulation.		 	 	 12	 caught	and	how	it	was	caught	and	that	all	these	activities	took	place	in	compliance	with	a	verifiable	 regulatory	framework.		 The	objectives	of	the	CCS	are	threefold:	 a) ensuring	product	traceability	at	all	production	stages	from	catch	to	marketing	including	 processing	and	transport;	 b) enabling	flag	States	to	better	monitor	the	fishing	activities	carried	out	by	its	vessels	and	so	 support	compliance	with	conservation	and	management	rules;	and	 c) providing	a	legal	basis	for	cooperation	between	flag	States	countries	of	processing	and	of	 marketing	and	improving	the	dissemination	of	information.	 As	all	the	products	entering	the	EU	market	have	to	be	accompanied	by	this	certificate	the	EU	importer	 must	ensure	that	the	consignment	to	be	imported	has	a	validated	certificate	provided	by	the	exporter	 prior	to	the	importation	to	the	EU.	Normally	the	responsible	for	emitting	the	catch	certificate	is	the	 Fisheries	Authority	of	the	flag	country	of	the	vessel.	As	well	as	with	the	health	certificate	IUU	regulation	 is	based	on	the	responsibility	and	commitments	of	third	countries.	 While	the	effectiveness	of	the	IUU	Regulation	and	the	CCS	has	been	heavily	criticised	by	various	parties	 including	the	EU	Parliament	itself2	the	requirements	implicit	in	the	official	validation	of	the	certificate	 by	authorities	of	the	flag	state	could	not	be	substantiated	without	an	effective	traceability	system.	 4 Methodology	 Following	the	strategy	detailed	in	Section	3.3	the	activities	took	place	under	the	following	methodology	 agreed	with	the	project	coordinators.	 4.1 Concepts	harmonization		 The	authors	considered	important	to	standardize	the	understanding	of	traceability	and	other	concepts	 relevant	to	the	present	study	based	on	the	relevant	bibliography	known	to	them	as	this	would	be	the	 only	way	to	evaluate	all	the	country	studies	under	the	same	methodology.	 4.1.1 Definitions	of	traceability		 In	the	last	two	decades	traceability	has	become	a	popular	concept	in	industrial	logistics	(Opara	2003)	 regardless	of	the	production	regime	and	type	of	product	(Flapper	Fransoo	Broekmeulen	&	Inderfurth	 2002;	Jansen-Vullers	van	Dorp	&	Beulens	2003).	Nevertheless	tackling	the	theoretical	aspects	of	 traceability	seems	to	be	difficult.		 In	some	supply	chains;	such	as	those	in	the	food	industry	the	disputes	begin	with	the	definition	of	 traceability.	Different	branches	of	the	food	industry	have	different	perceptions	about	the	meaning	of	 traceability	despite	common	requirements	and	drivers	that	generally	extend	across	industries	(JansenVullers	et	al.	2003).	Thus	many	researchers	simply	do	not	mention	any	definition	of	traceability	in	their	 articles	refer	to	at	least	two	meanings	of	it	or	make	up	their	own	definition	(Olsen	&	Borit	2013).	 A	typical	misconception	of	laypeople	and	many	authors	(for	examples	see	Olsen	and	Borit	2013)	is	that	 traceability	is	only	a	numeric	code	attached	to	products	that	it	actually	means	place	of	origin	or	that	it	 is	a	method	to	ensure	that	information	about	the	product	is	true.		 The	professional	controversy	continues	with	the	granularity	and	the	depth	of	traceability	�	how	small	 should	the	identified	unit	be	(e.g.	a	crate	of	shrimps	or	�a	season	of	skipjack	tuna	harvest�).	This	subject	 is	followed	by	whether	the	entire	supply	chain	(e.g.	from	field/farm/hook	to	plate)	or	only	parts	of	the	 supply	chain	should	be	covered	by	traceability	requirements	and	whether	this	coverage	should	be	 based	on	risk	assessment	(e.g.	steps	in	production	in	which	pathogens	are	inactivated).		 																																								 																				 2 	Compliance	of	imports	of	fishery	and	aquaculture	products	with	EU	legislation	 http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/etudes/join/2013/513968/IPOL-PECH_ET(2013)513968_EN.pdf		 	 	 13	 Other	points	of	disagreement	include	the	breadth	of	traceability	i.e.	the	amount	of	information	the	 system	records	(McEntire	et	al.	2010)	and	the	body	that	should	be	responsible	for	implementing	 traceability	i.e.	the	legislature	or	the	industry.	In	conclusion	traceability	has	been	both	a	politically	and	 strategically	controversial	issue	and	has	acted	as	a	major	deterrent	for	multi-disciplinary	cooperation	 and	understanding	(Vorst	2004).	On	a	deeper	level	the	multiple	perceptions	about	the	meaning	and	 applicability	of	traceability	held	by	different	people	may	be	related	to	idiosyncratic	cultural	backgrounds	 and	therefore	to	their	basic	notions	of	trust	and	transparency	requirements	(Hofstede	2004).	 Following	this	suggestion	it	has	been	noted	that	transparency	does	not	equate	to	traceability	(EgelsZand�n	Hulth�n	&	Wulff	2014)	because	the	latter	only	sets	the	framework	for	the	former.	 The	present	work	uses	the	definition	of	traceability	from	ISO	8402:1994	as	this	incorporates	all	the	 critical	properties	of	a	traceability	system	as	described	in	the	scientific	literature	(Olsen	&	Borit	2013).	 Thus	traceability	of	any	given	product	refers	to	�the	ability	to	trace	the	history	application	or	location	of	 an	entity	by	means	of	recorded	identifications.�		 In	a	product	sense	it	may	relate	to:	the	origin	of	materials	and	parts;	the	product	processing	history;	 and	the	distribution	and	location	of	the	product	after	delivery.	This	definition	clearly	states	what	should	 be	traced	(history	application	and	location)	and	how	the	tracing	should	be	done	(by	means	of	recorded	 identifications).		 There	are	several	principles	(or	requirements)	that	must	be	followed	for	the	traceability	system	to	be	 effective.	It	is	critical	that	these	recordings	are	interconnected	and	in	a	format	that	allows	the	product	 to	be	tracked	along	the	entire	supply	chain.	Thus	units	that	are	traced	(traceable	resource	units	(TRUs)	 e.g.	a	box	of	mackerel)	and	identification/numbering	schemes	that	provide	codes/numbers	used	for	the	 unique	identification	of	TRUs	(e.g.	GS1	barcodes)	are	parts	of	a	traceability	system	(Borit	&	Olsen	 2012).		 For	this	system	to	be	effective	it	is	essential	that	the	codes	of	a	TRU	(either	as	a	raw	material	or	semifinished	product)	entering	a	link	in	the	supply	chain	are	associated	uniquely	with	those	of	the	same	item	 (semi-finished	or	end	product)	leaving	the	link.	This	ability	to	identify	products	individually	is	the	basis	of	 product	traceability	(Jansen-Vullers	et	al.	2003;	Kelepouris	Pramatari	&	G.	Doukidis	2007;	Moe	1998;	 Poli	2004;	Porter	Baker	&	Agrawal	2011).	Equally	critical	is	maintaining	accurate	records	of	the	 transformations	(e.g.	splitting	joining)	that	the	TRU	undergoes	and	sharing	the	TRU	identification	code	 with	partners	in	the	supply	chain	(Kelepouris	et	al.	2007;	Nachay	2011).	This	approach	is	consistent	 with	the	FAO	guidelines	on	traceability	(COFI:FT	2014).	 Based	on	these	arguments	this	study	maintains	that	traceability	is	an	infrastructure	that	can	be	used	by	 control	agencies	for	two	purposes.	The	first	purpose	is	to	retrieve	different	data	for	various	reasons	 (such	as	environmental	sustainability	documentation	or	contamination	concerns).	The	second	purpose	is	 to	verify	these	data	with	their	specific	means;	e.g.	genetic	identification	of	species	such	as	in	the	 seafood	mislabelling	cases	identified	by	studies	such	as	those	reported	in	Helyar	et	al.	2014	(haddock	 labelled	as	cod;	tilapia	sushi	labelled	as	white	tuna	sushi).	Mislabelling	in	this	cases	�presents	substantial	 challenges	for	the	sustainable	management	of	the	respective	fisheries�	(Helyar	et	al.	2014).		 As	discussed	in	the	literature	�a	traceability	system	is	quite	similar	to	a	filing	cabinet	in	that	they	both	 deal	with	systematic	storing	and	retrieving	of	data.	Importantly	neither	a	traceability	system	nor	a	filing	 cabinet	care	about	what	types	of	data	are	being	stored�	(Olsen	&	Borit	2013).	This	notion	has	several	 important	consequences.		 For	instance	there	is	no	guarantee	that	the	recordings	are	true	or	complete	as	both	error	and	fraud	can	 lead	to	false	claims	about	the	properties	of	the	food	product	including	its	origin.	There	is	a	clear	need	to	 verify	these	claims	and	in	this	area	analytical	methods	and	instruments	play	a	crucial	role.	Similarly	 documenting	traceability	and	documenting	eco-label	type	chain	of	custody	are	two	different	concepts.	 Although	traceability	can	be	used	as	a	tool	in	the	certification	process	traceability	and	certification	are	 nonetheless	different	process	(Borit	&	Olsen	2012).	 	 	 14	 There	are	solutions	simpler	than	traceability	for	partial	product	tracking	such	as	when	the	regulator	 only	requires	operators	to	identify	their	suppliers	or	customers.	This	process	is	less	efficient	and	more	 inaccurate	because	tracing	product	sources	can	only	be	attempted	by	means	of	a	formal	and	often	 lengthy	examination	of	each	link	in	the	chain.	To	clarify	it	is	appropriate	to	employ	terms	such	as	stepby-step	(one-step-forward-one-step-backward)	or	chain	traceability	instead	of	the	comprehensive	name	 of	traceability.	The	principle	of	the	correct	denomination	of	traceability	systems	should	also	be	complied	 with	by	certification	and	documentation	schemes	which	are	also	becoming	increasingly	common	 among	private	actors	(Nilsson	Tun�er	&	Thidell	2004).	These	requirements	for	correct	denomination	of	 procedures	also	involve	the	responsibility	to	inform	producers	and	consumers	of	the	concepts	applied	 and	their	limitations.	 4.1.2 Catch	documentation	schemes	 Catch	documentation	schemes	designed	to	address	IUU	fishing	from	a	Monitoring	Control	and	 Surveillance	(MCS)	point	of	view	or	from	a	trade	documentation	perspective	are	important	tools	in	the	 IUU	fishing	fight	however	they	per	se	are	not	equivalent	to	traceability	systems	(Borit	&	Olsen	2012).		 Hence	is	important	to	define	the	authors�	perspective	in	terms	of	the	domain	language	used	in	 complementarity	to	other	FAO	initiatives3.		 A	Catch	Documentation	Scheme	(CDS)	for	the	certification	of	legal	provenance	is	referred	to	as	Catch	 Certification	Scheme	(CCS);	the	central	document	should	be	referred	to	as	a	Catch	Certificate	(CC)	�	as	 opposed	to	a	Catch	Document	or	a	Catch	Form.	Logbooks	and	landing	records	also	are	catch	 documentation	schemes.	 The	primary	objective	of	a	CCS	is	to	ascertain	and	assure	the	legal	provenance	of	fisheries	products	 through	government	certification	of	landed	catches	providing	for	their	traceability	throughout	the	 supply	chain	and	restricting	domestic	and	international	trade	of	a	species	(or	group	of	species)	to	 batches	of	products	which	are	accompanied	by	the	relevant	certificates.	In	doing	so	the	CDS	scheme	 will	obstruct	market	access	to	non-certified	and/or	non-certifiable	products	of	IUU	origin	thus	directly	 contributing	as	a	market	measure	to	combatting	IUU	fishing.	 As	a	secondary	objective	a	CCS	can	also	achieve	other	purposes.	One	such	secondary	objective	which	 requires	no	modification	is	the	near-real	time	monitoring	of	landed	quantities	of	fish	making	the	CCS	a	 prime	candidate	to	monitor	the	filling	of	quotas	in	TAC	managed	fisheries.	However	it	important	to	 assure	that	achieving	the	secondary	objectives	does	not	imply	the	modification	or	complexification	of	 the	CCS	because	of	the	risks	of	undermining	the	effectiveness	of	the	scheme	in	achieving	its	primary	 objective.	 Other	fisheries-related	information	such	as	Catch-Per-Unit-Effort	(CPUE)	data	is	better	handled	through	 alternative	tools	such	as	logbook	and/or	observer	programs.	CCS	(CDS)	systems	should	not	overlap	 with	or	be	used	to	duplicate	replicate	or	validate	data	collected	through	other	means	�	they	should	be	 singularly	focused.	 4.1.3 Health	/	Sanitary	export	certification	 Export	certificates	are	documents	that	confirm	the	safety	and	suitability	of	food	products	being	 exported	from	a	country.			These	are	issued	as	a	matter	of	cause	as	a	market	access	requirement	but	 can	be	as	well	a	national	requirement	of	the	export	country.	While	not	all	destination	countries	require	 them	they	can	help	facilitate	border	clearance.		 When	food	products	are	accompanied	by	an	export	certificate	it	means	that	they	meet	all	applicable	 national	and/or	specific	market	access	standards.	 The	information	registered	by	a	certificate	depends	on	the	food	product	and	the	destination	market.	It	 may	carry	information	such	as:	 																																								 																				 3 	FAO	Areas	Beyond	National	Jurisdiction	Program	(ABNJ)	-	Activity	on	Tuna	CDS	Best	Practice.	 	 	 15	 � the	country	of	origin	of	the	product	and	its	ingredients;	 � the	heat	treatment	or	other	processes	used	when	manufacturing	the	product;	 � the	microbiological	status	of	the	product;	 � the	product's	health	status	�	for	example	whether	or	not	a	certain	animal	disease	is	present	in	the	 country	of	origin.	 There	are	several	different	kinds	of	export	certificates:	 Health	or	sanitary	certificates	 Health	or	sanitary	certificates	are	government-to-government	certificates	that	include	information	 about	the	product	its	health	status	and	the	consignor.	 Official	assurances	 An	official	assurance	is	a	government-to-government	assurance	confirming	that	the	products	meet	both	 domestic	and	the	destination	country�s	requirements.	Official	assurances	are	only	issued	for	countries	 where	the	national	CA	has	negotiated	an	agreement	with	the	destination	market	as	part	of	an	official	 assurance	programme.	 Free	sale	certificates	(FSCs)	 FSCs	are	consignment-based	documents	provided	to	facilitate	trade	in	markets	that	require	a	statement	 about	the	safety	and	suitability	of	the	food	and	food-related	products	that	are	exported.	 Free	sale	advice	statements	(FSASs)	 FSASs	are	registration	documents	used	to	facilitate	trade	in	markets	that	require	food	products	be	 registered.	FSASs	exclude	wine	and	most	animal	products.	 While	traceability	may	have	a	role	in	in	the	different	type	of	certifications	these	certification	schemes	 per	se	are	not	equivalent	to	traceability	systems.	 In	this	study	food	safety	is	understood	as	the	conditions	and	practices	that	preserve	the	quality	of	food	 to	prevent	contamination	and	foodborne	illnesses.		 However	due	to	the	limitations	of	the	analysis	the	study	focused	only	on	sanitary	eligibility	involving	 the	traceability	system	associated	to	the	unique	identification	in	terms	of	control	of	sanitary	and	 operational	conditions	that	the	production	chain	of	seafood	in	a	country	is	required	to	comply	with	and	 is	therefore	controlled	and	verified	by	a	suitable	CA	 4.1.4 Chain	of	custody		 In	agreement	with	(Borit	&	Olsen	2012)	the	authors	of	this	study	understand	that	in	the	fish	industry	 the	term	��chain	of	custody��	has	taken	on	a	more	specific	meaning.	Documentation	of	chain	of	custody	 is	part	of	what	is	required	for	certification	especially	certification	related	to	use	of	eco-labels.		 The	exact	chain	of	custody	requirements	vary	but	in	two	important	areas	there	is	in	practice	a	 difference	between	documenting	traceability	and	documenting	eco-label	type	chain	of	custody:		 (1)	��Traceability��	is	a	purely	descriptive	term	and	one	can	split	and	join	(fish)	products	as	much	as	one	 likes	and	still	have	traceability	as	long	as	one	documents	the	fact	that	the	units	(for	instance	the	boxes	 of	fish)	have	been	split	up	or	joined	together.	There	are	very	specific	rules	for	what	one	is	allowed	to	do	 in	order	to	maintain	the	chain	of	custody	as	defined	by	the	eco-label	certification	standards.	A	typical	 rule	might	be	��you	are	not	allowed	to	mix	together	fish	from	two	different	suppliers��.	In	this	respect	 eco-label	type	chain	of	custody	requirements	(��do	not	mix��)	is	stricter	than	the	traceability	 requirements	(��mix	as	much	as	you	like	as	long	as	you	document	it��).	 2)	Beyond	the	rules	about	not	mixing	eco-label	type	chains	of	custody	requirements	contain	no	 provision	for	keeping	separate	units	and	associated	recordings.	If	the	rule	is	��you	are	not	allowed	to	mix	 together	fish	from	two	different	suppliers��	there	is	(from	an	eco-label	type	chain	of	custody	view)	no	 difference	between	two	boxes	of	fish	that	come	from	that	same	certified	supplier	even	if	the	fish	is	 caught	by	different	vessels	or	on	different	days.	In	a	good	traceability	system	this	is	regarded	as	 	 	 16	 essential	information	and	the	boxes	should	have	separate	unique	identifiers	and	separate	sets	of	 properties.	In	this	respect	traceability	requirements	(��if	units	are	physically	separated	they	should	be	 documented	separately��)	are	stricter	than	the	eco-label	type	chain	of	custody	requirements	(��as	long	as	 you	do	not	mix	in	violation	of	the	eco-label	rules	you	do	not	need	to	differentiate	between	units	that	 are	of	the	same	category��).	 4.1.5 Regional	Fisheries	Management	Organizations	 FAO	defines4	Regional	Fisheries	Management	Organizations	(RFMOs)	as	Regional	Fishery	Bodies	(RFBs)	 with	a	management	mandate.	These	bodies	adopt	fisheries	conservation	and	management	measures	 that	are	binding	to	their	members.	RFMOs	can	define	Conservation	and	Management	Measures	that	are	 binding	to	its	members	(hence	defining	legality	of	practices	and	catches)	as	well	a	CDS	or	more	general	 documentation	schemes.	 RFBs	are	mechanisms	through	which	states	or	organizations	that	are	parties	to	an	international	fishery	 agreement	or	("agreement"	is	fundamental	and	different	from	arrangement)	arrangement	work	 together	towards	the	conservation	management	and/or	development	of	fisheries.	(Some	RFBs	 especially	those	with	an	ecosystem	mandate	work	with	seabirds	etc.	that	are	connected	with	fisheries	 but	are	not	fish	stocks	per	se.)	 The	mandates	of	RFBs	vary.	Some	RFBs	have	an	advisory	mandate	and	provide	advice	decisions	or	 coordinating	mechanisms	that	are	not	binding	for	their	members.	The	functions	of	RFBs	also	vary.	They	 can	include	the	collection	analysis	and	dissemination	of	information	and	data	coordinating	fisheries	 management	through	joint	schemes	and	mechanisms	serving	as	a	technical	and	policy	forum	and	 taking	decisions	relating	to	the	conservation	management	development	and	responsible	use	of	the	 resources.	 The	difference	between	a	"regional	fishery	body"	and	a	"regional	fishery	arrangement"	is	that	the	 former	has	established	a	secretariat	that	operates	under	a	governing	body	of	member	states	and	the	 latter	does	not	have.	 Regional	Organizations	(ROs)	International	Organizations	(IOs)	and	Bilateral	Organizations	(BOs)	on	 their	side	have	a	more	limited	role	in	terms	of	compliance	however	are	freer	as	to	provide	institutional	 strengthening	and	capacity	building	in	fisheries	and	traceability	related	issues	to	its	member	countries.	 4.2 Evaluation	frameworks		 The	study	divided	the	analysis	in	two	complementary	areas:	analysis	of	the	information	provided	by	the	 reports	(text	analysis)	and	the	coding	of	that	information	in	the	matrix	analysis.		 Gaps	found	under	each	of	the	evaluation	components	will	then	provide	for	the	recommendations	at	 country	level.	The	most	common	issues	found	will	support	the	rationale	behind	the	general	 recommendations	of	the	study.	 4.2.1 Matrix	development	and	analysis	 As	indicated	in	Section	3.3	to	analyse	the	content	of	the	10	country	reports	and	evaluate	to	what	 degree	the	existing	or	proposed	traceability	scheme	enable	the	identification	of	IUU	fish	and	sanitary	 eligibility	this	study	utilised	a	coding	scheme	based	on	a	simplified	and	adapted	version	of	the	 evaluation	framework	for	requirements	related	to	data	recording	and	effective	traceability	designed	to	 prevent	IUU	fishing	described	by	(Borit	&	Olsen	2012).	As	to	standardize	all	the	comparison	(and	 simplify	the	matrix)	the	authors	referred	to	IUU	fishing	operations	according	to	(OECD	2004	2005)	and	 the	definition	of	IUU	fishing	and	IUU	fishing	vessel	from	EU	Regulation	No.	1005/2008.	Thus	the	 evaluation	matrix	comprises	descriptors	necessary	to	identify	IUU	fishing	activity	IUU	fish	IUU	fishing	 vessels	IUU	fishing	ports	IUU	fishing	operators.		 																																								 																				 4 	http://www.fao.org/fishery/topic/16800/en		 	 	 17	 This	Regulation	includes	tacitly	FAO	International	Plan	of	Action	to	Prevent	Deter	and	Eliminate	Illegal	 Unreported	and	Unregulated	Fishing	(IPOA)	and	FAO	Port	State	Measures	Agreement	(PSMA)	as	its	 provisions	are	built	on	these	documents.	We	adapted	the	matrix	to	the	purpose	of	this	study	by	adding	 the	descriptors	relevant	for	food	safety.	Therefore	the	final	matrix	contained	descriptors	for:	illegal	(and	 party	unreported)	fishing	data;	food	safety	data;	efficient	traceability	systems	data.	In	addition	the	 matrix	covered	all	the	points	in	the	production	chain	that	are	vulnerable	for	infiltration	of	IUU	fish	from	 sea	to	export.	 The	same	template	matrix	was	used	for	each	of	the	10	reports	thus	in	the	end	10	matrices	were	filled	 in.	The	text	of	the	reports	were	read	thoroughly	and	coded	in	the	respective	cells	of	the	evaluation	 matrix	by	one	rater.	At	this	step	the	rater	looked	for	specific	text	referring	to	each	descriptor	rather	 than	general	and	imprecise	text.	For	example	if	the	report	text	reads:	�all	fish	products	are	traceable	 from	catch	to	final	consumer�	these	words	cannot	in	themselves	be	analysed	but	the	specific	ones	 which	refer	to	concrete	measures	taken	to	enable	the	traceability	of	fish	products	can	be.	 The	scoring	of	individual	entries	in	the	matrices	�	as	well	as	the	logical	operations	performed	 with	these	scores	�	can	be	explained	in	terms	of	three-valued	logic	(Breuer	1972).	An	individual	 entry	in	the	matrix	could	only	take	one	of	three	possible	values	{false	equivocal	true}	 depending	respectively	on	whether	the	requirement	was	absent	(false	proposition)	equivocal	 (fuzzy	proposition)	or	clearly	defined	and	addressed	(true	proposition).	At	a	further	analysis	 the	equivocal	category	was	split	in	two:	not	clear/fuzzy	and	partially	true	(i.e.	true	only	for	 some	species	fisheries	vessels).	Thus	the	coding	set	contained	the	following	values:	{false:	0	 equivocal:	1	2	true:	3}.		 In	addition	colour	codes	were	used	to	indicate	if	the	reports	mentioned	any	authority	 monitoring	and	verifying	the	data	recording	process	devised	the	respective	traceability	system:	 the	report	clearly	indicates	a	third	party	the	report	clearly	indicates	a	government	agency	the	 report	is	not	clear	about	this	the	report	clearly	indicates	that	there	is	no	monitoring	and	 verifying	of	the	data	recording	process�.			 	Logical	operations	occur	when	calculating	the	final	value	of	production	chain	coverage	or	traceability	 (e.g.	requirement	C)	from	two	or	more	requirements	(e.g.	A	and	B).	In	this	qualitative	characterisation	 the	value	of	the	requirement	C	for	the	production	chain	(horizontal	analysis)	and	traceability/IUU	 fishing/food	safety	(vertical	analysis)	was	the	result	of	the	logical	conjunction	operation	i.e.	A	^	B.		 Thus	in	the	final	assessment	the	results	of	this	logical	operation	can	only	take	three	values:	true	(3)	if	 present	in	all	requirements	false	(0)	if	absent	in	any	requirement	and	equivocal	(?)	in	all	other	cases.	To	 further	distinguish	partly	effective	traceability	(i.e.	traceability	that	allows	for	a	system	that	would	 function	to	a	limited	extent)	from	the	non-effective	the	majority	function	was	chosen	to	be	used	in	all	 the	false	cases.	Thus	traceability	was	set	to	false	only	when	n/2	arguments	or	more	were	false	where	n	 is	the	number	of	traceability	conditions	(Valiant	1984)	and	to	partly	effective	in	all	other	cases.		 When	performing	the	vertical	analysis	it	happened	that	not	all	the	IUU	fishing/food	safety	data	were	 captured	by	the	reports	and	in	this	case	the	authors	had	to	interpret	in	what	degree	the	recorded	data	 is	helpful	in	IUU	fishing	deterrence/food	safety	assurance.		 The	matrixes	per	se	are	not	part	of	the	report	as	a	measure	to	protect	the	confidentiality	of	the	 information	there	contained	the	matrixes	can	be	provided	on	request	by	the	authorities	of	the	 concerned	country.	 4.2.2 Report	analysis		 Due	to	the	varied	nature	of	the	reports	it	was	realized	that	a	fully	objective	approach	to	their	 evaluation	based	on	the	matrixes	discussed	in	Section	4.2.1	while	very	useful	in	some	countries	would	 render	very	limited	information	on	others.		 Hence	a	more	holistic	analysis	would	be	required	to	complement	the	matrixes.	Furthermore	the	 	 	 18	 authors�	opinion	was	that	due	to	the	lack	of	standardization	and	uniform	quality	of	the	SWOT	analysis	 provided	in	the	10	reports	their	utility	was	limited.	In	many	studies	the	information	gathered	was	 oversimplified	and	some	information	fitted	into	more	than	one	category	or	was	slotted	into	an	 inappropriate	category.	Moreover	in	the	end	such	an	analysis	invariably	relied	on	subjective	 judgments.	Objective	measures	of	all	the	components	simply	do	not	exist.		 In	order	to	standardize	the	analysis	the	authors	proposed	adapting	the	methodology	presented	by	 (MRAG	Asia	Pacific	2010)	as	a	framework	to	evaluate	the	traceability	mechanisms	in	each	country	and	 then	elucidate	gaps	and	current	best	practices.		 Thus	each	country�s	study	is	briefly	presented	in	this	report	and	the	traceability	system	described	in	the	 country	study	is	evaluated	against	three	components:	inclusivity	impermeability	and	verifiability.	 4.2.2.1 Inclusivity		 Inclusivity	evaluates	the	extent	to	which	the	system	is	designed	to	provide	traceability	for	all	legallycaught	fish	of	the	country	in	question.	If	the	sole	objective	of	the	scheme	is	to	prevent	the	products	of	 IUU	fishing	and	those	originated	from	non-sanitary	approved	operators	from	reaching	the	market	 inclusivity	is	not	particularly	important	as	long	as	all	fish	that	do	enter	the	market	are	properly	 documented.		 If	there	are	legally	caught	fish	that	are	not	incorporated	into	the	traceability	scheme	this	greatly	 compromises	the	usefulness	of	the	scheme	for	monitoring	compliance.	In	particular	under	such	 circumstances	it	would	not	be	expected	that	the	number	of	fish	documented	would	match	the	number	 of	fish	caught.	In	addition	the	potentially	wrongful	exclusion	of	otherwise	legal	fish	on	the	grounds	that	 they	lack	documentation	could	be	a	problem	for	fair	trade.	Inclusivity	should	therefore	be	as	high	as	 possible	for	maximum	effectiveness	and	defensibility.		 4.2.2.2 Impermeability		 Impermeability	evaluates	the	extent	to	which	the	scheme	is	designed	to	exclude	non-traceable	fish.	The	 traceability	scheme�s	impermeability	directly	determines	its	effectiveness	for	both	combating	IUU	 fishing	and	for	monitoring	sanitary	compliance.	It	should	be	noted	that	a	scheme	may	be	highly	 impermeable	but	not	very	inclusive.		 It	is	worth	to	note	that	while	high	impermeability	is	desirable	marginal	improvements	in	schemes	that	 are	already	highly	impermeable	may	incur	high	costs	and	diminishing	returns.		 4.2.2.3 Verifiability		 Verifiability	evaluates	the	extent	to	which	those	other	than	the	parties	directly	responsible	for	filling	out	 and	validating	the	documentation	audit	the	traceability	scheme.		 The	existence	of	penalties	or	sanctions	for	improper	documentation	is	also	taken	into	account.	A	third	 issue	is	the	extent	to	which	any	audit	result	is	used	not	only	to	accept	or	reject	individual	shipments	but	 also	to	identify	patterns	in	IUU	fish	trade	and/or	systemic	weaknesses	in	the	scheme.		 Those	schemes	that	currently	have	the	most	robust	checks	and	balances	are	considered	to	represent	 best	practice.		 4.3 Limitations	of	the	methodology	 As	discussed	before	this	study	assessed	the	individual	country	based	on	the	interpretation	of	the	 secondary	sources	provided	(i.e.	the	10	reports).	Hence	the	quality	of	this	study�s	interpretation	 depends	on	the	quality	of	the	source	report	when	reflecting	the	legal	provisions	of	the	respective	 country	in	connection	with	IUU	fishing	sanitary	measures	and	traceability.		 While	members	of	the	authors�	team	are	more	or	less	familiar	with	the	realities	of	some	of	the	analysed	 countries	this	knowledge	was	not	reflected	in	the	assessment.	 	 	 19	 5 Analysis	results	 5.1 Individual	country	analysis	 5.1.1 Argentina	 Argentina�s	report	addresses	partially	the	assessment	of	traceability	by	cataloguing	a	substantial	 amount	of	regulations	many	of	them	not	truly	related	to	the	issue	in	hand.	None	of	these	defines	or	 requests	traceability	or	its	institutionalization	per	se. The	product	value	chain	in	Argentina	can	be	complex	involving	auctions	and	landings	distributed	among	 different	processors	that	then	consolidate	into	one	export	consignment.	 The	traceability	system	described	in	the	reports	is	primary	linked	to	the	landing	reports	issued	by	DNCP	 (Direcci�n	Nacional	de	Coordinaci�n	Pesquera	�	National	Directorate	for	Fisheries	Coordination)	and	a	 sanitary	certification	issued	by	SENASA	(Servicio	Nacional	de	Sanidad	y	Calidad	Agroalimentaria	�	 National	Office	for	Food	Safety	and	Quality).	These	documents	are	attached	to	the	transport	documents	 and	to	the	invoice	supplied	to	the	factories	with	the	product	coming	from	each	vessel.	 Each	processing	plant	has	a	log	of	all	products	entering	and	leaving	(local	sales	exports).	DNCP	and	 SENASA	representatives	control	products	entering	or	leaving	a	plant	when	these	are	based	in	the	 plants	which	is	not	always	the	case.		 Plant	logs	are	required	to	be	weekly	contrasted	with	the	landing	reports	from	DNCP.	The	plant	logs	are	 checked	with	the	frozen	stored	products.	For	the	same	reason	SENASA	does	not	control	every	product	 at	the	plant	entrance	but	has	an	office	in	each	plant	and	develops	regular	inspections	in	cold	stores	and	 during	processing	operations.	If	fresh	products	have	to	be	exported	SENASA	representative	is	in	the	 plant	to	control	the	products	at	the	entrance	gate.	However	is	not	clear	how	this	works	out	in	reality.	 SENASA	also	inspects	the	exported	products	and	issues	the	sanitary	certificate	for	export	but	no	details	 are	given	on	the	depth	and	scope	of	this	activity.	 As	traceability	is	evaluated	along	the	industrial	production	chain	(90%	of	the	processing	establishments	 in	the	country	are	authorised	for	the	EU	and	the	US	market)	consequently	operators	are	required	to	 have	plans	in	regards	with	traceability	compliance;	nevertheless	this	limits	the	traceability	spectrum	to	 those	products	that	are	exported.	 Hence	the	functionality	of	the	traceability	system	is	limited	in	relationship	to	the	basic	lack	of	a	 systemic	and	legal	framework	in	which	to	define	and	assess	it.	 While	in	principle	the	system	seems	effective	as	the	traceability	to	vessels	or	origin	is	a	sanitary	 certification	requirement	nevertheless	there	seems	to	be	a	risk	associated	with	product	passed	to	 processors	by	middleman	and	fish	buyers	as	well	as	�pre	processors�	(fazones)	that	process	�on	behalf�	 bigger	Food	Business	Operators	(FBOs)	whose	standing	in	the	traceability	system	both	from	a	sanitary	 and	fisheries	stand	point	is	not	clear	in	the	report.	 The	suitability	of	the	traceability	system	seems	to	be	compromised	in	principle	by	the	lack	of	 organisational	strength	provided	due	to	the	lack	of	a	legal	standing	and	standardization	of	traceability	 along	all	elements	of	the	production	chain.		 Traceability	is	mostly	implemented	as	a	EU	and	US	market	requirement	and	not	a	national	standard.	 Furthermore	it	has	been	the	domain	of	the	health	certification	whose	core	functions	do	not	include	 legal	origin	and	mass	balance	along	the	production	change.	 The	report	itself	recognises	the	present	limitations	of	traceability	in	the	country	by	concluding	that;	��	 although	 infrastructure	 and	 systems	 are	 improving	 in	 general	 traceability	 still	 can	 be	 considered	 as	 weak	 as	 there	 is	 a	 lack	 of	 financial	 resources	 to	 carry	 out	 long	 term	 traceability	 programs	 and	 poor	 information	management	systems	along	the	chain	from	capture	to	marketing�.	 Based	on	the	above	analysis	the	authors	can	infer	the	following	about	the	described	traceability	scheme	 	 	 20	 described:	 Inclusivity:	The	scheme	responds	mostly	to	export	market	access	requirements	and	is	enforced	only	for	 some	species	of	interest	to	those	markets.	It	is	not	inclusive	to	all	landings	and/or	harvests.	Hence	is	not	 fully	inclusive.	 Impermeability:	There	are	systems	developed	to	control	the	legality	of	landings	and	mitigation	 strategies	along	the	production	chain	but	these	do	not	seem	to	be	generalized	among	all	the	landings	 and	the	complex	national	processing	structure.	Hence	the	system	is	not	fully	impermeable.	 Verifiability:	Traceability	is	verified	by	the	CA	in	function	of	the	commercial	interest	associated	only	to	 exports	but	not	as	intrinsic	part	of	the	national	compliance	system.	Hence	the	system	is	not	fully	 verifiable.	 5.1.1.1 Matrix	Analysis	 IUU	fishing	data:	It	seems	that	the	traceability	system	imposed	by	the	legislation	analysed	by	the	report	 is	able	to	provide	most	of	the	relevant	information	for	identification	of	IUU	fishing	at	the	�at	sea�	part	of	 the	production	chain.	The	same	can	be	inferred	for	several	points	of	the	�at	landing�	part	of	the	chain	 (i.e.	ports	and	operators	facilities)	and	of	the	�on	shore�	part	(i.e.	final	processing	and	export).	However	 based	on	the	text	of	the	report	we	can	say	that	the	traceability	system	captures	less	of	this	relevant	 information	at	the	remaining	points.	In	some	parts	of	the	production	chain	and	for	some	data	the	 recording	process	is	monitored	and	verified	by	a	government	agency.	 Food	safety	data:	Food	safety	systems	that	meet	HACCP	requirements	seem	to	be	established	and	 verifiable	at	least	on	the	export	market	production	chain.	Sanitary	eligibility	in	terms	of	the	EU	market	 requirements	seems	to	be	in	place	with	Food	Business	Operators	(FBOs)	uniquely	identified	however	 the	standing	of	middleman	and	processors	�on	behalf�	is	not	clear	in	the	report.	 Traceability	Assessment:	The	report	does	not	provide	enough	information	in	order	to	assess	if	the	 principles	of	effective	traceability	systems	are	met.	 5.1.1.2 Recommendation	 While	the	country	has	a	developing	regulatory	structure	aimed	to	control	IUU	fishing	it	should	define	 and	institutionalize	traceability	requirements	and	controls	starting	from	the	domestic	prerequisite	for	 the	registry	of	fishing	business	operators.	Once	this	is	achieved	the	valid	recommendations	of	the	 report	could	be	implemented	more	effectively.	 The	data	recording	requirements	should	be	modified	so	the	traceability	system	captures	the	IUU	fishing	 relevant	data	at	all	the	points	in	the	production	chain.	 5.1.2 Barbados	 Barbados	fisheries	is	largely	focused	around	a	small	pelagic	fishery	resource	in	the	in	the	southern	 Lesser	Antilles	and	is	exploited	by	a	group	of	seven	small	island	states	(Dominica	Martinique	Grenada	 St.	Vincent	and	the	Grenadines	Saint	Lucia	and	Trinidad	and	Tobago).	It	is	exploited	mainly	as	a	food	 source	by	Barbados	which	is	responsible	for	over	60%	of	the	regional	flyingfish	catch.	Expanding	fleet	 capacity	and	limited	implementation	of	cooperative	measures	are	cause	for	concern	that	the	resource	 may	be	become	overfished	if	not	properly	managed	at	the	national	and	regional	levels.		 The	Fisheries	Division	provides	physical	infrastructure	at	common	landing	sites	in	the	form	of	 computerised	catch	recording	program	(CARIFIS)	to	facilitate	statistical	data	gathering.	Vessel	and	fisher	 identification	information	and	catch	quantity	is	recorded	however	the	current	database	lacks	specific	 data	in	relation	to	catch	identification	area	dates	the	vessel	involved	and	any	transhipment	activity.		In	 order	to	correct	this	the	Fisheries	Division	has	begun	to	draft	legislation	which	will	mandate	the	use	of	 logbooks	on	national	fishing	vessels.	 The	national	legislation	1993	Fisheries	Act	(amended	in	2000)	may	be	considered	to	vaguely	address	the	 prevention	of	IUU	fishing	by	tactfully	placing	the	right	to	deny	or	rescind	fishing	rights	at	the	discretion	 	 	 21	 of	the	Chief	Fisheries	Officer	or	the	Minister	of	Agriculture	as	appropriate	on	the	basis	of	the	following	 blanket	condition	of	�proper	management	of	fisheries	resources�.			Sanctions	are	commonly	applied	to	 the	owner	charterer	and	master	as	appropriate	in	cases	of	legislative	violation.	No	specific	mention	is	 made	however	of	standards	for	presenting	evidence	of	illegal	fishing	activity.		 The	hospitality	sector	purchases	70%	of	the	filleted	flyingfish	produced	in	the	island	and	is	responsible	 for	the	sale	of	80%	of	the	cooked	flyingfish	to	consumers	including	tourists.	The	prevalence	and	 profitability	of	local	flyingfish	consumption	makes	the	issue	of	export	a	low	priority	in	the	eyes	of	 decision	makers.	As	there	is	consistent	local	demand	and	(as	yet)	minimal	foreign	demand	for	the	 commodity	local	agricultural	health	and	food	control	(AHFC)	is	currently	considered	adequate	for	the	 purposes	of	this	particular	fishery.		Hence	the	combined	efforts	make	up	the	existing	agricultural	health	 and	food	control	regime	have	resulted	in	an	adequate	system	which	effectively	minimizes	risk	in	terms	 of	local	food	safety	through	appropriate	application	of	technical	capacity	and	infrastructure	for	 monitoring	and	inspection.	The	current	system	is	not	in	alignment	with	international	standards	 guidelines	and	codes	of	practice	and	therefore	not	equivalent	to	the	sanitary	and	phytosanitary	(SPS)	 measures	implemented	by	potential	international	trading	partners.		The	Inter-American	Institute	for	 Cooperation	on	Agriculture	(IICA)	and	the	World	Organisation	for	Animal	Health	(OIE)	during	2008-2009	 found	a	number	of	weaknesses	contributing	to	non-compliance.	Therefore	Barbados	does	not	have	a	 sanitary	agreement	or	any	facilities	listed	for	the	EU.	 Implementation	of	IUU	prevention	measures	is	limited	by	inadequate	and	out	dated	legislation	 regulation	and	management	plans	lack	of	monitoring	control	and	surveillance	and	inadequate	 resources	for	implementation	despite	the	existence	of	relevant	regional	and	international	guidelines	 and	commitments.		 Due	to	the	lack	of	a	traceability	system	the	sector	lacks	the	capacity	to	maintain	records	of	harvest	data	 throughout	the	supply	chain.	Identification	of	unique	batches	of	fish	begins	in	the	post-harvest	sector	if	 at	all	and	the	design	of	internal	traceability	procedures	are	typically	driven	by	food	safety	or	financial	 accounting	concerns	with	no	regard	for	IUU	fishing	prevention	or	sustainable	fisheries.	 As	a	result	traceability	remains	non-existent	in	the	Barbados	fishing	industry	except	in	a	minority	of	 cases	in	which	private	sector	entities	have	dictated	the	use	of	internationally	compliant	measures	by	 their	suppliers	in	the	fishing	industry	even	despite	regional	pressure	for	implementation	by	regional	 instruments.	It	is	planned	that	traceability	and	the	application	of	best	practices	along	the	supply	chain	 will	be	implemented	upon	operationalization	of	the	NAHFCA	in	the	near	future	but	no	specific	 management	plans	related	to	the	flyingfish	fishery	and	IUU	fishing	prevention	exist	in	the	pipeline.	 Based	on	the	above	analysis	the	authors	can	infer	the	following	about	the	described	traceability	scheme	 described:	 Inclusivity:	There	appears	to	be	no	scheme	in	place	except	of	private	sector	entities	for	export	or	 financial	gains.		 Impermeability:	There	is	no	real	regulation	but	reference	to	auspices	of	proper	and/or	precautionary	 fisheries	management	measures	 Verifiability:	Requirements	and	resources	are	significantly	lacking	to	undertake	this	activity.	 5.1.2.1 Matrix	Analysis		 IUU	fishing	data:	Based	on	the	information	included	in	the	report	the	data	relevant	for	IUU	fishing	 identification	prevention	and	deterrence	are	not	registered.	 Food	safety	data:	The	current	system	meets	local	requirements	and	is	not	in	alignment	with	 international	standards	guidelines	and	codes	of	practice	and	therefore	not	equivalent	to	the	sanitary	 and	phytosanitary	(SPS)	measures	implemented	by	potential	international	trading	partners.	 Traceability	Assessment:	Based	on	the	information	of	the	report	the	principles	of	effective	traceability	 systems	are	not	met.	 	 	 22	 5.1.2.2 Recommendations		 Except	the	general	recommendation	of	registering	all	the	IUU	relevant	data	and	following	all	the	 requirements	of	effective	traceability	the	authors	cannot	formulate	any	recommendations	based	on	the	 matrix	analysis	due	to	lack	of	relevant	data	provided	by	the	analysed	report.	 5.1.3 Morocco	 The	report	is	relevant	and	comprehensive	it	includes	most	of	the	important	aspects	and	the	 requirements	for	having	a	traceability	system	as	Morocco	has	very	close	linkages	with	the	EU	market	 via	various	private	and	official	agreements	with	the	EU	has	expanded	into	other	geographical	markets.	 A	traceable	unit	is	defined	as	the	amount	of	fish	landed	at	a	given	time	by	a	particular	vessel.	The	catch	 certificate	will	be	validated	if	the	unit	has	sufficient	quantity	at	the	time	of	exporting	that	is	creating	an	 account	for	this	unit	to	be	debited	in	the	circuit	and	used	for	export.	 The	driver	for	following	traceability	requirements	is	a	function	of	the	value	of	the	fish.		Where	the	value	 of	the	fish	is	deemed	low	the	inclination	of	the	fishermen	to	provide	information	is	 less	than	the	high	 value	species	destined	for	more	lucrative	markets.		 Vessel	Monitoring	System	(VMS)	are	in	place	for	the	creation	of	catch	reports	by	the	captain	for	coastal	 and	 artisanal	 fishing	 catches	 which	 are	 afterwards	 validated	 by	 the	 DPM.	 The	 first	 sale	 document	 (purchase	 statement)	 is	 then	 submitted	 by	 the	 ONP	 to	 the	 wholesaler	 who	 has	 at	 his	 disposal	 the	 information	 in	 the	 catch	 report	 and	 the	 purchase	 statement.	 Computerized	 traceability	 system	 (SAMACNA)	 is	 established	 with	 the	 intention	 of	 reducing	 the	 use	 of	 paper	 documents	 and	 ensuring	 continuous	traceability	and	verification	from	landing	to	export	however	it	is	not	fully	integrated.	 The	factory	gains	access	to	the	catch	information	from	the	wholesaler	to	establishes	a	catch	transfer	 which	together	with	the	information	contained	in	the	other	documents	allows	the	factory	owner	to	 ensure	the	traceability	required	to	be	transmitted	to	the	exporter.			At	the	end	of	the	chain	the	exporter	 will	have	all	the	traceability	needed	to	ask	for	the	validation	of	the	catch	certificate.		 For	offshore	fisheries	the	pattern	is	much	simpler.	The	catches	are	generally	directly	exported	reducing	 the	number	of	key	stakeholders.	 Implementation	and	adoption	of	legal	framework	(Law	No.	15-12)	on	the	prevention	and	the	fight	 against	IUU	fishing	has	faced	challenges.	Hence	the	law	establishing	the	rules	to	be	observed	by	fishing	 vessels	to	land	and	/	or	tranship	fishery	products	in	the	Moroccan	ports	and	also	laying	down	measures	 to	ensure	that	fishery	products	marketed	in	Morocco	are	not	derived	from	IUU	fishing	is	not	fully	 implemented	or	enforced.	 Based	on	the	above	analysis	the	authors	can	infer	the	following	about	the	described	traceability	scheme	 described:	 Inclusivity:	The	system	looks	to	include	all	parts	of	the	supply	chain	and	defines	the	traceable	unit	back	 to	the	vessel.	However	not	enough	information	is	provided	as	to	define	its	total	inclusiveness.	 Impermability:	As	the	systems	begin	on	the	vessel	the	system	is	enforced	as	the	information	flow	is	 consistent.	However	not	enough	information	is	provided	as	to	define	its	full	impermiability.	 Verifiability:		Systems	exist	both	in	paper	and	electronic	form	to	allow	for	the	variability	of	competent	 authority	to	assess	data	captured.	However	not	enough	information	is	provided	as	to	define	its	total	 verifiability.	 5.1.3.1 Matrix	Analysis	 IUU	fishing	data:	The	report	does	not	provide	enough	information	in	order	to	assess	if	the	data	relevant	 for	IUU	fishing	deterrence	are	recorded	by	the	traceability	system.	The	few	data	provided	are	unclear.	 However	it	seems	that	the	�at	sea�	step	in	the	production	chain	is	the	one	that	the	report	(and	 implicitly	the	legislators)	focused	most	on	as	some	IUU	fishing	relevant	data	are	recorded	at	this	step.	In	 some	parts	of	the	production	chain	and	for	some	data	the	recording	process	is	monitored	and	verified	 	 	 23	 by	a	government	agency.	 Food	safety	data:		It	is	implied	that	food	safety	systems	are	in	place	for	the	Moroccan	fisheries	products	 to	meet	the	EU	Market	Access	Requirements	however	the	level	and	standards	being	met	are	not	 inferred	not	the	effectiveness	of	food	safety	related	traceability	in	the	non-EU	and	domestic	sector.			 Traceability:	Except	the	information	about	the	unique	logistic	unit	identifier	that	is	recorded	at	almost	 all	the	points	in	the	production	chain	the	report	does	not	provide	enough	information	in	order	to	assess	 if	the	principles	of	effective	traceability	systems	are	met.		 5.1.3.2 Recommendation.		 Except	the	general	recommendation	of	registering	all	the	IUU	relevant	data	and	following	all	the	 requirements	of	effective	traceability	the	authors	cannot	formulate	any	recommendations	based	on	the	 matrix	analysis	due	to	lack	of	data	provided	by	the	analysed	report.	 5.1.4 Peru	 Peru�s	report	addresses	the	assessment	of	traceability	analysis	by	cataloguing	a	substantial	amount	of	 regulations	unfortunately	not	all	of	them	related	to	the	issues	at	hand.		 Encouragingly	since	2013	Peru	(Ley	N�	30063)	defines	traceability	in	law	as	part	of	the	creation	and	 functions	of	SANIPES	as	the	Competent	Authority	for	seafood	safety	and	official	assurances	for	the	 export	market.	Their	definition	reads	(translated	from	Spanish):	 Traceability:	Also	called	tracing	or	tracking.	Possibility	to	find	and	follow	the	trail	through	the	entire	 production	chain	of	a	food	feed	hydro-biological	resource	for	production	food	or	substance	intended	to	 be	incorporated	in	food	or	feed	or	likely	to	be.	The	law	also	makes	SANIPES	responsible	of�	sets	 standards	directives	guidelines	guides	systems	plans	and	procedures	for	guidance	needed	to	comply	 with	this	purpose.	 Prior	to	this	traceability	was	only	legislated	officially	for	bivalves5.	As	in	other	countries	traceability	was	 enforced	as	a	food	safety	related	Market	Access	Requirement	for	the	production	chain	aimed	to	exports	 and	later	as	a	fishery	management	measure.	The	requirements	were	drafted	by	different	official	bodies	 that	do	not	act	normally	in	coordination.	Furthermore	Peru�s	fisheries	profile	is	highly	segmented	 accordingly	to	the	type	of	products	and	the	use;	human	consumption	(HC)	or	non-human	consumption	 (NHC	i.e.	fish	meal)	hence	implementation	of	traceability	is	to	be	complex.	 In	the	industrial	fisheries	sector	(mostly	non-human	consumption	by	volume)	the	production	chain	is	 relatively	short	which	helps	to	keep	traceability	systems	simple.	A	logbook	(bitacora)	is	compulsory	for	 all	industrial	fishing	vessels	and	in	many	cases	this	is	compared	with	the	observer�s6	(TCI)	reports.	 Landing	reports	are	filed	at	ports	barges	or	operations	by	�bitacoreros�	that	have	been	delegated	 control	functions	(3rd	party	organizations	as	SGS	and	CERPER)	and	these	in	turn	relay	information	to	the	 fisheries	CA.	As	this	product	is	not	aimed	for	HC	the	seafood	safety	CA	has	limited	involvement.	 The	opposite	scenario	applies	to	the	small	scale/artisanal	fisheries	sector	which	is	the	major	source	of	 exports	for	human	consumption.	In	addition	control	from	the	fisheries	side	is	delegated	to	weaker	 regional	organizations	and	as	the	production	chain	involves	middlemen	(comerciantes/acopiadores)	 (who	are	not	under	the	control	of	either	fisheries	and/or	sanitary	CAs)	the	permeability	and	verifiability	 of	the	scheme	is	limited	even	if	there	is	transport	document	(guia)	to	be	employed	for	internal	 transport	which	focus	more	on	proving	that	the	products	have	not	been	stolen	than	on	traceability.	 The	sanitary	CA	requires	traceability	of	product	to	individual	vessels	in	the	artisanal	sector	however	as	 they	are	not	involved	in	verifying	the	volumes	landed	vs.	the	carrying	capacity	of	the	fishing	vessels	and	 mass	balance	exercises	they	have	to	rely	on	the	information	provided	by	exporters	only.	 																																								 																				 5 	Acuerdo	Consejo	Directivo	N�	029-015-2010-ITP/CD		Control	oficial	relativo	a	la	trazabilidad	de	los	moluscos	bivalvos	 6 	Tecnico	Cientifico	de	Investigacion		 	 	 24	 Hence	the	functionality	of	the	traceability	system	is	limited	in	relationship	to	the	scope	in	which	to	 define	it	and	assess	it.	Said	so	traceability	is	legally	defined	and	allocated	as	core	function	to	the	sanitary	 CA	hence	this	is	great	building	block	to	further	develop.	 The	suitability	of	the	traceability	system	is	compromised	in	principle	for	the	limited	scope	in	relationship	 to	the	total	spectrum	of	fisheries	activities	and	a	lack	of	institutional	collaboration	in	between	the	 fisheries	and	the	sanitary	CA.	 The	report	itself	recognises	the	present	limitations	of	traceability	in	the	country	by	concluding	that:	�	 �The	authorities	have	to	implement	control	systems	in	artisanal	fishing	vessels	and	small	scale�	Apply	 control	measures	in	smaller	scale	and	artisanal	vessels	and	�.	Develop	programs	formalization	of	 artisanal	vessels	in	collaboration	with	the	Regional	Governments�	 Based	on	the	above	analysis	the	authors	can	infer	the	following	about	the	described	traceability	scheme	 described:	 Inclusivity:	The	scheme	responds	mostly	to	export	market	access	requirements	and	is	enforced	only	for	 some	species	of	interest	to	those	markets.	It	is	not	inclusive	to	all	landings	and/or	harvests.	Hence	is	not	 fully	inclusive.	 Impermeability:	There	are	systems	developed	to	control	the	legality	of	landings	and	mitigation	 strategies	along	the	production	chain	but	these	do	not	seem	to	be	generalized	among	all	the	landings	 and	the	complex	national	processing	structure.	Hence	the	system	is	not	fully	impermeable.	 Verifiability:	Traceability	is	verified	in	function	of	the	commercial	interest	associated	to	exports	by	a	CA	 or	by	a	contracted	3rd	party	for	some	of	the	non	Human	Consumption	landings	but	not	as	intrinsic	part	 of	the	national	compliance	system.	Hence	the	system	is	not	fully	verifiable.	 5.1.4.1 Matrix	Analysis	 IUU	fishing	data:	It	seems	that	the	traceability	system	imposed	by	the	legislation	analysed	by	the	report	 is	able	to	provide	most	of	the	relevant	information	for	identification	of	IUU	fishing	at	the	�at	sea�	part	of	 the	production	chain	(where	the	data	recording	process	is	monitored	by	a	government	authority).	The	 same	can	be	inferred	for	the	point	�operators	facilities�	(where	the	data	recording	process	is	monitored	 by	a	third	party)	at	the	�at	landing�	part	of	the	chain	and	explicitly	only	for	some	species	at	the	point	 �ports�	same	part	of	the	chain	and	point	�final	processing�	and	�export�	at	the	�on	shore�	part	of	the	 production	chain.	For	all	the	other	points	the	report	data	are	missing	or	not	clear.		 Food	safety	data:	Food	safety	systems	that	meet	HACCP	requirements	are	established	and	verifiable	at	 least	on	the	export	market	production	chain.	Sanitary	eligibility	in	terms	of	the	EU	market	requirements	 seems	to	be	in	place	with	Food	Business	Operators	(FBOs)	uniquely	identified	however	the	sanitary	 standing	and	traceability	back	to	the	vessels	on	the	small	and	artisanal	sector	is	incomplete.	 Traceability:	The	report	does	not	provide	enough	information	in	order	to	assess	if	the	principles	of	 effective	traceability	systems	are	met.	 5.1.4.2 Recommendation.		 While	the	country	has	a	developed	regulatory	structure	aimed	to	control	IUU	fishing	it	is	mostly	aimed	 to	one	industrial	(non	human	consumption)	fisheries	sector	and	to	its	bivalve	rearing	operations.	The	 human	consumption	sector	is	mostly	small	scale	and	under	the	control	of	regional	offices	instead	of	a	 centrally	organised	structure	therefore	less	effective.	The	country	should	aim	to	standardize	systems	 along	the	whole	sector.	 Based	on	the	matrix	analysis	it	is	recommended	that	IUU	fishing	relevant	data	is	recorded	at	all	the	 points	in	the	production	chain	including	at	the	�at	landing�	and	�on	shore�	parts	of	the	chain.	 5.1.5 Senegal	 Senegal�s	 drivers	 for	 traceability	 and	 management	 of	 IUU	 fishing	 are	 for	 product	 destined	 for	 the	 European	Market	only.		Local	markets	are	only	concerned	with	sanitary	measures.			 	 	 25	 There	was	no	definition	for	traceability	within	the	text	although	the	general	concept	was	used	 throughout	the	report.			 Legal	and	regulatory	framework	 is	 fully	enforced	for	registration	of	and	 licencing	of	 industrial	vessels.		 There	appears	to	be	inadequate	framework	and	loose	enforcement	for	traditional	fisheries.			 Directorate	for	the	Protection	and	Surveillance	of	Fisheries	(DPSF)	is	in	charge	of	the	implementation	of	 the	 policy	 defined	by	 the	 State	 in	 terms	of	marine	 and	 continental	 fisheries.	Monitoring	 control	 and	 surveillance	 to	 enforce	 the	 established	 management	 measures	 is	 carried	 out	 in	 collaboration	 with	 structures	such	as	the	Directorate	of	Marine	Fisheries	(DMF)	the	National	Marine	the	Oceanographic	 Research	 Center	 of	 Dakar-Thiaroye	 (CRODT)	 the	 National	 Gendarmerie	 the	 Customs	 services	 Dakar	 Port	 Authorities	 professionals	 and	 the	 local	 communities	 of	 fishermen	 in	 the	 framework	 of	 the	 participatory	surveillance	of	traditional	fisheries.	 Monitoring	and	control	are	undertaken	through	documents	and	electronic	systems	to	best	capture	and	 communicate	data.	 	Validation	steps	for	the	 information	captured	appear	to	occur	at	each	step	of	the	 process	until	the	point	that	the	product	is	processed	and	not	intended	for	export.			 Based	on	the	above	analysis	the	authors	can	infer	the	following	about	the	described	traceability	scheme	 described:	 Inclusivity:	The	scheme	responds	to	industrial	vessels	and	is	not	focused	on	traditional	fisheries.	Hence	 cannot	be	identified	as	fully	inclusive.	 Impermeability:	There	are	developed	systems	to	monitor	and	surveillance	by	multiple	bodies	both	 government	and	industry	to	prevent	IUU	fishing	activities.	However	due	to	the	fragmented	control	 structure	the	systems	cannot	be	assess	as	fully	impermeable.	 Verifiability:		Verification	of	process	appears	to	occur	at	sea	at	landing	and	in	instances	where	product	is	 processed	intended	for	export.		Verification	for	local	market	is	primarily	focused	on	sanitary	measures.	 However	due	to	the	fragmented	control	structure	the	systems	cannot	be	assess	as	fully	verifiable.			 5.1.5.1 Matrix	Analysis	 IUU	fishing	data:	The	legislation	analysed	by	the	report	requires	that	only	few	IUU	fishing	relevant	data	 are	recorded	along	the	supply	chain	and	only	for	some	species.	None	of	the	points	of	the	three	parts	of	 the	production	chain	(�at	sea�	�at	landing�	�on	shore�)	is	fully	covered	by	these	requirements.	In	some	 parts	of	the	production	chain	and	for	some	data	the	recording	process	is	monitored	and	verified	by	a	 government	agency.	 Food	safety	data:	Unique	identification	exists	throughout	the	supply	chain	however	the	standards	being	 operated	too	are	not	implied.	 Traceability:	According	to	the	analysed	report	very	few	data	relevant	for	assessment	of	efficient	 traceability	requirements	are	recorded	at	some	points	of	the	production	chain.	Otherwise	the	report	 does	not	provide	enough	information	in	order	to	assess	if	the	principles	of	effective	traceability	systems	 are	met.	 5.1.5.2 Recommendation.		 The	 recommendation	 suggested	 to	 prevent	 IUU	 fishing	 activities	 is	 the	 development	 of	 an	 efficient	 traceability	 system.	Based	on	 the	matrix	 analysis	 it	 is	 recommended	 that	 IUU	 fishing	 relevant	data	 is	 recorded	at	all	the	points	 in	the	production	chain	and	that	the	effective	traceability	principles	cover	al	 the	points	of	the	supply	chain.	 5.1.6 Sri	Lanka	 Sri	Lanka	has	a	rich	and	expansive	exclusive	economic	zone	that	plays	an	important	part	in	the	economy	 as	well	as	providing	more	than	50%	of	the	protein	requirements	for	the	local	population.			 Traceability	practises	of	small	pelagic	fisheries;	shrimp	lobster	and	cephalopods	are	not	really	 developed	as	the	large	pelagic	fishes.	Regulatory	structure	is	well	established	to	prevent	IUU	fishing	 	 	 26	 activities	of	this	variety	however	monitoring	and	surveillance	activities	at	a	field	level	are	deemed	to	be	 week	and	need	to	be	strengthened.	 Regulatory	requirements	under	the	Fisheries	and	Aquatic	resource	act	and	subsequent	amendments	 exist	to	enforce	registration	annually	and	to	have	a	valid	operating	licence	for	fishing	method	and	 equipment.	Mechanized	fishing	vessels	are	required	to	record	catch	in	a	logbook	this	is	well	 implemented	for	multiday	vessels	but	not	successful	in	the	more	artisanal	fleet.		Verification	of	data	 collected	from	the	multiday	vessels	is	well	established	but	once	again	gaps	exist	in	the	artisanal	fleet.			 Infrastructure	for	transporting	and	processing	fish	under	sanitary	conditions	is	not	established	and	 hence	the	ability	to	achieve	certification	to	recognised	standards	is	not	possible.		It	is	noted	as	one	of	 the	strengths	that	food	safety	requirements	are	well	in	place	for	export	fish	products.		 However	the	Commission's	assessment	�Sri	Lanka	has	not	sufficiently	addressed	the	shortcomings	in	its	 fisheries	control	system	identified	in	November	2012.	The	main	weaknesses	include	shortcomings	in	the	 implementation	of	control	measures	a	lack	of	deterrent	sanctions	for	the	high	seas	fleet	as	well	as	 lacking	compliance	with	international	and	regional	fisheries	rules�.		As	a	result	the	Commission	tables	a	 ban	on	fisheries	products	caught	by	Sri	Lankan	vessels	being	imported	into	the	EU.	 Based	on	the	above	analysis	the	authors	can	infer	the	following	about	the	described	traceability	scheme	 described:	 Inclusivity:		Application	is	mainly	focused	on	the	large	pelagic	fisheries;	smaller	artisanal	fisheries	are	 excluded	from	the	requirements.	However	due	to	the	fragmented	control	structure	the	systems	cannot	 be	assess	as	fully	inclusive.	 Impermeability:	Opportunities	to	exploit	could	be	achieved	through	the	lack	of	implementation	of	 control	measures.	Hence	cannot	be	assessed	as	impermeable	 Verifiability:	Regulatory	requirements	exist	for	large	pelagic	fisheries;	smaller	artisanal	fisheries	are	 excluded	from	this	activity	as	a	consequence	the	system	in	not	fully	verifiable.	 5.1.6.1 Matrix	Analysis	 IUU	fishing	data:	Based	on	the	information	included	in	the	report	the	data	relevant	for	IUU	fishing	 identification	prevention	and	deterrence	are	not	registered	except	in	some	cases	at	the	�at	sea�	point	 of	the	production	chain.	In	these	cases	the	data	recording	process	at	this	point	is	monitored	by	a	 government	agency.	 Food	safety	data:	Implies	that	requirements	to	meet	export	markets	are	in	place	however	basic	 infrastructure	is	not	in	place	to	meet	these	requirements.	 Traceability:	The	report	does	not	provide	enough	information	in	order	to	assess	if	the	principles	of	 effective	traceability	systems	are	met.	 5.1.6.2 Recommendations	 Except	the	general	recommendation	of	registering	all	the	IUU	relevant	data	and	following	all	the	 requirements	of	effective	traceability	the	authors	cannot	formulate	any	recommendations	based	on	the	 matrix	analysis	due	to	lack	of	data	provided	by	the	analysed	report.	 5.1.7 Tanzania	 This	report	addresses	the	fact	that	even	though	policy	and	strategy	statements	exist	to	address	fisheries	 management	they	are	not	well	implemented.			 Traceability	is	detailed	upon	in	The	Fisheries	Act	(CAP.	279):		�the	management	of	fish	and	aquaculture	 establishment	shall	for	the	purpose	of	traceability	from	upstream	to	a	market	recall	and	retrieval	of	the	 fish	and	fishery	product	develop	a	traceability	system	which	shall	include:	location	vessel	date	of	 landing/catch/harvest	and	quantity	date	of	processing	name	(common	and	scientific)	state	of	product	 and	quantity.�			 Requirements	are	in	place	for	the	registration	of	fishing	crafts	in	spite	of	their	existence	and	the	 	 	 27	 relatively	low	fee	for	licences	most	fishing	and	related	activities	are	informal.		Other	legal	provisions	are	 in	place	to	encourage	professionalization	of	fisheries	and	other	related	activities	but	are	deemed	futile.	 The	 system	 for	 traceability	 practices	 in	 Tanzania	 is	 largely	 revenue	 driven	 and	 is	 centred	 round	 a	 certification/permit	system	which	involves	numbers	of	procedures	in	order	to	get	permits.	The	permits	 are	given	for	both	 local	and	foreign	vessels	for	fishing	 in	Tanzania	 in	these	particular	fisheries	and	for	 importation	 or	 exportation	 of	 fisheries	 products	 produced	 and	 processed	 in	 Tanzania.	 	 The	 current	 system	found	to	be	complicated	which	does	not	have	impact	in	fisheries	since	it	focus	on	revenue	rather	 than	management	of	sustainable	fisheries	in	Tanzania.		 As	 the	 report	 was	 written	 as	 an	 explanation	 of	 the	 legislation	 and	 requirements	 as	 opposed	 to	 the	 actually	practise	of	undertaking	them	 it	 is	hard	to	determine	 if	 there	are	any	activities	 legitimately	at	 play	that	are	implemented	well.	 Based	on	the	above	analysis	the	authors	can	infer	the	following	about	the	described	traceability	scheme	 described:	 Inclusivity:	The	regulations	and	legislation	is	inclusive	of	marine	fisheries	however	it	is	unclear	in	areas	 of	smaller	fisheries	where	this	is	hidden	in	obscure	parts	of	the	regulations.	However	due	to	the	 fragmented	control	structure	the	systems	cannot	be	assess	as	fully	inclusive.	 Impermeability:	It	is	unclear	in	the	report	where	areas	of	impermeability	may	occur	as	the	 implementation	of	the	regulations	in	practice	is	not	provided.	Hence	cannot	be	categorised	as	 Impermeable.	 Verifiability:	Verification	activities	are	undertaken	as	a	fault	finding	and	revenue	gathering	exercise	as	 opposed	to	strengthening	the	fisheries	management.	Hence	the	verifiability	of	the	system	does	not	 seem	to	be	complete.		 5.1.7.1 Matrix	Analysis	 IUU	fishing	data:	The	legislation	analysed	by	the	report	requires	that	only	very	few	IUU	fishing	relevant	 data	are	recorded	along	the	supply	chain	and	only	for	some	species.	The	data	recording	process	is	 verified	in	some	of	the	cases	by	a	government	agency	while	in	other	cases	(at	several	points	in	the	�at	 landing�	part	of	the	production	chain)	by	a	third	party.	None	of	the	points	of	the	three	parts	of	the	 production	chain	(�at	sea�	�at	landing�	�on	shore�)	is	fully	covered	by	these	requirements.	Otherwise	 the	report	does	not	provide	enough	information	about	the	data	to	be	recorded.	 Food	safety	data:		Systems	and	registration	in	place	for	the	purposes	of	exporting	not	seen	to	be	a	key	 aspect	of	local	production.		 Traceability:	The	report	does	not	provide	enough	information	in	order	to	assess	if	the	principles	of	 effective	traceability	systems	are	met.	 5.1.7.2 Recommendations	 Except	the	general	recommendation	of	registering	all	the	IUU	relevant	data	and	following	all	the	 requirements	of	effective	traceability	the	authors	cannot	formulate	any	recommendations	based	on	the	 matrix	analysis	due	to	lack	of	data	provided	by	the	analysed	report.	 5.1.8 Turkey	 Turkey�s	report	outlines	the	complexities	and	difficulties	of	implementing	EU	requirements.		This	is	 largely	due	to	the	traditional	and	small-scale	structure	of	the	fisheries	the	many	combinations	of	 fishermen	and	disembarkation	locations	mixed	fishing	tools	and	immigrant	fishermen.		Turkish	 legislation	covers	general	provisions	that	aim	to	inform	consumers	but	it	does	not	contain	all	the	 information	that	the	EU	legislation	requires.	 Traceability	is	defined	as	one-step-forward	and	one-step-backward	and	deemed	to	be	mandatory.		The	 specific	details	of	what	information	should	be	available	is	outlined	in	the	packaging	and	labelling	 standards	(Ministry	of	Food	Agriculture	and	Livestock	1995)	for	marketing	processed	seafood;	 	 	 28	 manufacturers	name	and	address	product	name	type	production	date	net	weight.		However	this	 standard	is	not	applied	to	seafood	under	50kg	that	are	being	marketed	by	local	fisherman.			 Tracing	tools	for	the	fisheries	and	aquaculture	have	been	implemented	since	2001	including	logbook	for	 fishing	vessels	over	12m	sales	report	(for	the	first	sale)	transport	document	and	certificate	of	origin.	 Fisheries	Law	(No.	1380)	enforces	taking	�Certificate	of	Origin�	from	the	Agriculture	Ministry	Province	or	 District	Offices	or	appointed	cooperatives	near	the	disembarking	location	that	enables	tracing	legally	 caught	seafood	from	the	catch	location	to	the	table	of	consumer	in	order	to	sale	and	transport.		 Automatic	Identification	System	(AIS)	is	mandatory	for	the	fishing	vessels	over	15	m	length	since	2010.		 As	of	2013	Turkey	has	been	collecting	almost	all	fishing	effort	data	(except	IUU)	by	fleet	register	system	 (GKS)	and	licences	fish	processing	and	catch	per	unit	effort	data	by	questionnaires	more	than	half	of	 the	landing	data	by	sales	notes	and	licences	and	nearly	half	of	the	biological	and	VMS	data	by	sampling	 within	fishery	data	collection	programme			SUBIS	integrated	Fleet	Register	System	has	been	effective	in	 collecting	vessel	data.	 Monitoring	and	traceability	could	not	be	fully	implemented	in	practice	which	would	allow	consumers	to	 monitor	seafood	from	catch	to	the	dish.	Misreporting	and	incomplete	logbooks	are	the	main	problems	 for	reliable	and	incomplete	usage	of	logbooks.		The	lack	of	traceability	causes	circulation	of	IUU	products	 on	the	market	and	marketing	of	less	valuable	products	as	if	they	are	valued	and	recognized	seafood.	 Based	on	the	above	analysis	the	authors	can	infer	the	following	about	the	described	traceability	scheme	 described:	 Inclusivity:		Application	of	regulations	is	only	applicable	to	vessels	greater	than	12m	or	the	sale	of	fish	 products	greater	than	50kg.	Hence	the	system	cannot	be	assessed	as	fully	inclusive.	 Impermeability:	Information	recorded	in	relation	to	catch	may	be	misreported	as	the	consequences	of	 being	caught	are	outweighed	by	the	value.	Hence	the	system	cannot	be	assessed	as	fully	impermeable.	 Verifiability:	Verification	activities	are	not	fully	undertaken	which	would	allow	the	full	traceability	from	 catch	to	consumer.	Hence	the	system	cannot	be	assessed	as	fully	verifiable.	 5.1.8.1 Matrix	Analysis		 IUU	fishing	data:	It	seems	that	the	traceability	system	imposed	by	the	legislation	analysed	by	the	report	 is	able	to	provide	some	of	the	relevant	information	for	identification	of	IUU	fishing	at	the	�at	sea�	part	 of	the	production	chain	and	at	the	first	part	of	the	�at	landing�	part	but	only	for	some	species.	The	data	 recording	process	in	these	cases	is	monitored	by	a	government	authority.	The	report	does	not	provide	 details	about	the	IUU	relevant	data	recording	requirements	for	the	other	points	in	the	production	chain.	 Food	safety	data:		The	application	of	food	safety	systems	or	requirements	are	not	implied	throughout	 this	report	however	a	member	state	the	EU	standards	and	requirements	for	processing	and	 registration	should	apply.	 Traceability:	For	some	species	it	seems	that	the	traceability	system	imposed	by	the	legislation	covers	 most	of	principles	of	effective	traceability	principles	at	the	�at	sea�	part	of	the	production	chain	and	at	 the	first	part	of	the	�at	landing�	part.	The	report	does	not	provide	details	about	this	aspect	for	the	other	 points	in	the	production	chain.	 5.1.8.2 Recommendations	 Based	on	the	matrix	analysis	it	is	recommended	that	IUU	fishing	relevant	data	is	recorded	at	all	the	 points	in	the	production	chain	and	that	the	effective	traceability	principles	cover	all	the	points	of	the	 supply	chain.	 5.1.9 Uganda	 The	application	of	EU	IUU	Regulation	excludes	fresh	water	fish.	Therefore	the	report	is	focused	on	 health	aspects	and	the	requirement	for	IUU	catch	certification	is	overlooked	in	this	report.	 Uganda	has	no	comprehensive	law	governing	safety	and	traceability	of	food	products.		The	liberalization	 	 	 29	 of	trade	and	open	access	nature	of	the	fishery	in	Uganda	has	led	to	the	deterioration	of	the	fishery	 outputs	especially	in	terms	of	quality.	 Most	of	Uganda�s	fish	is	exported	illegally	to	the	neighbouring	countries.		According	to	Bank	of	Uganda	 in	2007	30%	of	catches	from	Uganda	water	bodies	were	illegal	unregulated	or	unrecorded	(IUU).	 Practices	in	place	centralize	the	registry	of	fishing	vessels	and	the	issuance	of	number	plates	to	each	is	 currently	in	place	as	a	way	to	trace	fisheries.	 Fish	landing	sites	that	are	gazetted	(handling	export	products)	by	law	under	DFR	are	regulated	by	fish	 inspectors	under	the	respective	district	local	governments	working	through	the	semi-autonomous	local	 beach	management	units	(BMUs).	All	fish	landed	must	be	traced	by	source	species	and	volume	at	 landing	by	law	and	all	catches	must	be	registered	for	origin	and	destination	and	issued	with	a	fish	 movement	permit.		Verification	activities	are	undertaken	by	fish	inspectors	in	main	markets	and	border	 crossings.	 Where	actions	have	been	undertaken	to	address	immature	fish	trade	and	cross	border	illegal	fish	trade	 it	 initially	drove	demand	of	legal	size	fish	however	faced	a	challenge	of	corruption	through	bribes	and	 political	interference	and	driving	actions	to	disband	organisations	involved.	 Based	on	the	above	analysis	the	authors	can	infer	the	following	about	the	described	traceability	scheme	 described:	 Inclusivity:		The	coverage	of	the	systems	seems	to	be	limited	only	the	export	production	chain.	Hence	 it�s	not	inclusive.	 Impermeability:		Information	recorded	in	relation	to	catch	may	be	misreported	due	to	demand	for	 fisheries	out	weighing	consequences.	Furthermore	as	the	systems	focus	on	the	export	chain	the	 Impermeability	of	the	scheme	cannot	be	concluded.	 Verifiability:	Verification	activities	are	undertaken	by	fish	inspectors	for	the	source	species	and	volume	 but	the	verifiability	of	the	system	cannot	be	assured.		 5.1.9.1 Matrix	Analysis	 IUU	fishing	data:	The	legislation	analysed	by	the	report	requires	that	only	few	IUU	fishing	relevant	data	 are	recorded	along	the	supply	chain	and	only	for	some	species.	The	data	recording	process	in	these	 cases	is	monitored	by	a	government	agency.	None	of	the	points	of	the	three	parts	of	the	production	 chain	(�at	sea�	�at	landing�	�on	shore�)	is	fully	covered	by	these	requirements.	 Food	safety	data:		No	indication	was	provided	in	the	report	on	the	sanitary	standards	in	place	or	the	 identification	of	facilities.	 Traceability:	According	to	the	analysed	report	very	few	data	relevant	for	assessment	of	efficient	 traceability	requirements	are	recorded	at	some	points	of	the	production	chain.	Otherwise	the	report	 does	not	provide	enough	information	in	order	to	assess	if	the	principles	of	effective	traceability	systems	 are	met.	 5.1.9.2 Recommendations	 Except	the	general	recommendation	of	registering	all	the	IUU	relevant	data	and	following	all	the	 requirements	of	effective	traceability	the	authors	cannot	formulate	any	recommendations	based	on	the	 matrix	analysis	due	to	lack	of	relevant	data	provided	by	the	analysed	report.	 5.1.10 Vietnam	 The	Vietnam	report	provides	an	indication	of	the	proactive	government	initiatives	undertaken	prior	to	 the	introduction	of	EU	IUU	Regulation.		It	addresses	the	current	regulation	in	place	and	the	effectiveness	 of	implementation	and	key	failures	of	the	whole	system.	 Two	pieces	of	national	legislation	for	Vietnam	exist	in	relation	to	traceability	and	prevention	of	IUU	 including	Circular	No.	03/2011/TT-BNNPTNT	and	Circular	No.	28/2011/TT-BNNPTNT.		 	 	 30	 Ministry	of	Agriculture	and	Rural	Development	(MARD)	defined	�tracing�	as	meaning	the	possibility	to	 monitor	and	locate	a	product	unit	through	specific	steps	of	production	processing	and	distribution	(by	 Codex	Alimentarius	standards).	7		This	was	in	relation	to	the	tracing	and	recalling	of	fishery	products	 railing	to	meet	food	quality	and	safety	requirements.		 �Traceability�	was	identified	as	ability	to	monitor	a	unit	of	product	through	step	by	step	during	the	 producing	processing	and	providing	this	product.	This	Circular	also	set	requirements	on	traceability	such	 as	fishery	plants	have	to	set	a	traceability	system	by	�one-step-back	one-step-forward�	methodology	to	 ensure	the	finding	marking	a	unit	of	product	at	any	certain	steps.	 The	second	piece	of	legislation	was	focused	on	the	validation	of	catch	certificates	and	statements	for	 exportation	into	the	European	market	was	defined	Illegal	Unreported	and	Unregulated	(IUU)	fishing	 activities	are	considered	illegal	unreported	and	unregulated	if	organizations	and	individuals	engaged	in	 fishing	activities	commit	any	of	the	violations	listed.8	 Small	scale	multispecies	and	multiple	fishing	gears	are	special	characteristics	of	Vietnam	fisheries.		The	 application	of	regulations	was	defined	fishing	vessels	with	main	engine	capacity	of	50HP	or	greater	In	 addition	a	large	number	of	fishing	vessels	and	many	landing	sites	along	the	long	coast	are	leading	to	 many	difficulties	on	fisheries	management.	 Sub-DECAFIREP	has	the	responsibility	at	a	regional	level	to	monitor	fishing	vessels�	activities	store	 documents	organize	training	course	and	guide	to	owners	of	exported	enterprises	and	fishers	about	 traceability	and	IUU	prevention	regulations	and	finally	directly	provide	Catch	Certificates	as	well	as	 Catch	Statement	for	Raw	Materials.	 All	fishing	vessels	have	to	obtain	fishing	licenses	before	undertaking	fishing	operations.	Consequently	 the	issuance	of	fishing	licenses	is	based	solely	on	technical	safety	and	registration	instead	of	sustainable	 resource	management.		This	has	led	to	overcapacity	and	subsequently	to	economic	losses	eventually	 exacerbating	poverty	among	coastal	and	artisanal	fishers.	Nevertheless	it	is	also	well	recognized	that	 fishers	would	try	to	refrain	from	applying	for	fishing	licenses	and	certificates	when	they	are	constrained	 and	controlled	by	fishery	authorities	while	also	trying	to	purposely	delay	payment	of	registration	fees	 for	as	long	as	possible.	 Maintaining	fishing	reports	and	logbooks	is	compulsory	for	fishers	and	skippers	of	fishing	vessels	but	 managing	and	inspecting	the	information	provided	by	fishers	and	skippers	are	the	responsibility	of	 fishery	authorities	(Decision	3477/QD-BNN-KTBVNL).	In	reality	however	these	are	not	practiced	as	the	 procedures	would	require	considerable	amount	of	efforts	since	each	province	has	thousands	of	fishing	 vessels.		 Fishers	do	not	strictly	enforce	fishing	report	and	logbook	keeping	because	Vietnam�s	regulations	on	this	 are	not	complete.	There	are	no	current	laws	and	regulations	that	set	any	criteria	for	accurate	inputting	 into	logbooks	based	on	specific	requirements	for	keeping	fishing	logbooks	and	reporting	procedures	nor	 is	there	a	system	of	validating	the	data	reported.	Owners	also	fear	that	if	forced	to	fill	out	logbooks	 their	skippers	may	abandon	their	work	and	move	to	other	vessels.	In	general	the	process	to	achieve	the	 catch	certificate	is	not	satisfied	with	requirement	of	IUU	Regulation.		 Complexity	is	added	to	the	process	as	some	processing	facilities	buy	fishery	products	from	many	 middlemen	or	fishers	making	it	difficulty	for	authorities	on	traceability	Catch	Certificate	issuance.			 Trading	of	fish	products	in	Vietnam	is	usually	done	through	middlemen	whose	involvement	is	not	 documented	in	the	transhipment	process	of	fishery	products	at	sea.		There	is	no	regulatory	 requirement�s	for	middlemen�s	involvement	to	be	declared	on	the	Catch	Certificate	and	hence	the	 introduction	of	IUU	declared	catch	as	no	traceability	exists.		 The	catch	certification	form	is	submitted	by	exporters	to	fishery	authorities	but	in	order	to	receive	a	 																																								 																				 7 	Circular	No.	03/2011/TT-BNNPTNT	issued	on	21st	of	January	2011	 8 	Circular	No.	28/2011/TT-BNNPTNT	of	April	15th	2011	 	 	 31	 valid	catch	certificate	from	the	authorities	exporters	should	also	provide	copies	of	logbooks	together	 with	the	fishing	license	and	a	complete	catch	certificate	form.	Since	exporters	request	a	catch	certificate	 after	buying	fish	from	middlemen	the	information	may	not	be	as	precise	as	that	of	the	skipper�s.			It	is	 implied	that	exporters	could	just	write	any	species	and	corresponding	volume	caught	by	a	particular	 fishing	boat	as	verification	does	not	appear	to	be	occurring	in	the	issuance	of	certificates.	 The	report	infers	that	the	skipper�s	could	provide	appropriate	information;	such	as	features	of	the	 fishing	vessel	species	and	yields	in	the	catch	certificate	form	but	this	activity	is	not	currently	occurring.		 Inspection	by	concerned	authorities	is	not	effective	notwithstanding	a	requirement	in	the	IUU	 regulations	stipulating	the	need	for	authorities	to	carry	out	random	inspections	of	at	least	5%	of	the	 total	average	landings	and	trans-shipment	transactions	at	fishing	ports	each	year.	Regarding	tuna	 landings	the	concerned	authorities	are	not	able	to	inspect	fishing	vessels	at	ports	because	tunas	are	 unloaded	immediately	upon	landing.	By	the	time	fishery	authorities	receive	the	catch	certificate	 application	form	from	exporters	the	fish	is	already	in	processing	factories.	 Conflict	of	interest	and	competition	of	fishing	grounds	also	encourage	fishers	to	conceal	trip	information	 or	misstate	information	on	fishing	areas	and	routes	especially	in	cases	when	banned	species	are	caught	 or	when	highly	productive	fishing	grounds	are	discovered	which	could	attract	the	interest	of	other	 competing	fishers.	Reluctance	to	declare	catch	is	also	driven	by	the	government	might	impose	high	 taxes	on	them	and	that	they	might	have	to	pay	more	for	their	social	duties	 Forgoing	the	zealous	implementation	of	the	regulations	limitations	existed	in	the	fisheries	by	lack	of	 education	of	fisherman	where	only	11%	of	fishers	have	complete	secondary	school	or	high	education	 and	hence	do	not	have	the	skills	to	complete	necessary	documentation.		 Based	on	the	above	analysis	the	authors	can	infer	the	following	about	the	described	traceability	scheme	 described:	 Inclusivity:	The	scheme	responds	to	vessels	with	50HP	or	greater	but	does	not	capture	artisanal	fleet.	 Hence	is	not	totally	inclusive.	 Impermeability:	There	are	developed	systems	to	control	the	traceability	requirement	and	the	Catch	 Certificate	scheme	through	a	logbook	system	however	the	fisher�s	capacity	to	complete	the	required	 data	accurately	not	under	duress	is	questionable.	Hence	its	level	of	impermeability	is	questionable.	 Verifiability:	Traceability	is	verified	by	the	logbook	system	however	this	data	is	often	misrepresented	or	 not	recorded	at	all.	Verification	activity	is	not	robust	and	hence	not	enforced.	Therefore	the	system	 cannot	be	considered	a	verifiable.	 5.1.10.1 Matrix	Analysis		 IUU	fishing	data:	The	report	mentions	explicitly	that	only	few	IUU	fishing	relevant	data	are	recorded	 along	the	supply	chain	and	only	for	some	species.	The	data	recording	process	in	these	cases	is	 monitored	by	a	government	agency.	None	of	the	points	of	the	three	parts	of	the	production	chain	(�at	 sea�	�at	landing�	�on	shore�)	is	fully	covered	by	these	requirements.	Otherwise	the	report	does	not	 offer	any	information	about	the	other	data.	It	is	maybe	worth	to	mention	that	the	points	�at	sea�	and	 �export�	are	the	best	covered	by	recorded	data.	 Food	safety	data:		Food	safety	requirements	are	not	addressed	in	this	report;	there	is	no	indication	of	 the	regulations	in	place	or	if	there	is	any	system	to	identify	processors.	 Traceability:	According	to	the	analysed	report	very	few	data	relevant	for	assessment	of	efficient	 traceability	requirements	are	recorded	at	some	points	of	the	production	chain.	Otherwise	the	report	 does	not	provide	enough	information	in	order	to	assess	if	the	principles	of	effective	traceability	systems	 are	met.	 5.1.10.2 Recommendations	 Regulate	the	requirement	for	accurate	reporting	of	information	and	completion	of	log	books.		Support	 to	be	provided	to	fishers	to	assist	in	up-skilling	and	education	for	a	better	comprehension	of	 	 	 32	 requirements	and	to	build	capacity	within	the	industry	to	complete	required	documentation.		The	 inclusion	of	all	parts	of	the	supply	chain	to	be	involved	in	the	accurate	communication	of	information	 this	includes	middlemen.	 Except	the	general	recommendation	of	registering	all	the	IUU	relevant	data	and	following	all	the	 requirements	of	effective	traceability	the	authors	cannot	formulate	any	recommendations	based	on	the	 matrix	analysis	due	to	lack	of	data	provided	by	the	analysed	report.	 5.2 Overall	analysis	 5.2.1 Common	Issues		 Unfortunately	none	of	the	reports	provides	enough	information	to	assess	whether	the	principles	of	 effective	traceability	are	met	by	the	traceability	systems	of	the	10	respective	countries.	 Maybe	these	requirements	are	actually	provided	by	the	respective	legislation	however	the	authors	of	 this	study	cannot	infer	this	from	the	text	of	the	reports.	Nevertheless	some	common	issues	are	 identifiable	in	regards	the	expectations	of	the	terms	of	reference.	 5.2.1.1 Relevance	for	combating	IUU	fishing	 None	of	the	reports	provides	enough	information	to	assess	whether	the	data	recorded	by	the	 traceability	system	of	the	10	respective	countries	is	designed	to	record	data	relevant	for	IUU	fishing	 identification	deterrence	and	prevention.	Furthermore	the	fact	that	traceability	is	not	legally	defined	in	 most	countries	limits	the	legislative	ability	to	prosecute	when	based	on	evidence	originating	from	 analysing	data	recorded	by	traceability	systems.	 Hence	is	important	to	have	a	defined	methodology	in	regards	with	assessing	traceability	in	terms	of	its	 validity	as	a	tool	for	combating	IUU	fishing.		 Similarly	to	the	case	of	food	safety/sanitary	eligibility	most	countries	included	traceability	into	fisheries	 controls	as	a	response	from	the	demand	of	the	EU	market	�Catch	certification	scheme�	however	this	 seems	to	focus	only	on	species	or	fisheries	that	could	potentially	enter	the	EU	market	but	contribute	 little	to	the	rest	of	the	captures.	 5.2.1.2 Ensuring	Food	Safety	/	Sanitary	Eligibility	 With	the	exception	of	Barbados	all	of	the	countries	reported	are	authorised	to	export	to	the	EU	hence	 it	is	assumed	that	the	sanitary	controls	over	the	�EU	destined�	production	chain	are	to	be	considered	as	 equivalent	 to	 those	 in	 the	 Member	 States.	 Therefore	 the	 requirements	 in	 relation	 to	 sanitary	 traceability	as	defined	in	Regulation	178/2002	should	have	been	met.		 However	the	analysis	of	the	reports	shows	that	 is	not	always	the	case	and	the	omission	of	the	Rapid	 Alert	 System	 for	 Food	 and	 Feed	 (RASSF)9	 notifications	 and	 the	 review	 of	 the	 FVO	 reports	 for	 the	 respective	countries	in	relation	with	food	and	feed	safety	could	have	provided	additional	clarity	on	the	 implementation	of	traceability	within	the	country.	 Furthermore	the	fact	that	many	seems	to	run	a	�split�	system	(a	set	of	rules	for	the	EU	production	 chain	and	other	for	domestic	and	non	EU	exports)	has	created	parallel	channels	of	seafood	handling	 and	production	where	all	the	focus	of	traceability	has	been	only	as	a	consequence	of	a	perceived	 market	access	need.	 5.2.1.3 Reducing	vulnerability	to	threats	and	crises	especially	for	small	scale	sector	 Small-scale	fisheries	make	an	important	contribution	to	nutrition	food	security	sustainable	livelihoods	 and	poverty	alleviation	�	especially	in	developing	countries.	Despite	this	significant	contribution	the	 impact	of	ineffective	traceability	systems	small-scale	fisheries	remain	poorly	understood.		 																																								 																				 9 	RASSF	Portal	https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/rasff-window/portal/?event=SearchForm&cleanSearch=1#	 	 	 	 33	 The	analysis	of	the	country	studies	shows	that	with	the	exemption	of	Peru	(particularly	for	it	key	HC	 export	Giant	Squid	Dosidicus	gigas)	Senegal	and	Barbados	where	most	exports	originate	on	the	smallscale	sector	the	bulk	of	the	traceability	efforts	in	terms	of	sanitary	eligibility	and	legality	of	catches	is	 focused	on	the	industrial	sector.	In	developing	countries	with	limited	resources	to	monitor	compliance	 chances	are	that	the	small	scale	and	artisanal	sector	are	to	be	the	less	controlled	and	therefore	most	 exposed	to	threats.	 Besides	the	environmental	impact	and	the	associated	threat	to	food	security	IUU	fishing	also	harms	a	 range	of	other	actors.	IUU	fishing	results	in	significant	economic	losses	for	legitimate	fishers	and	to	legal	 fisheries	in	general.	IUU	fishing	depletes	fish	populations	which	could	otherwise	be	fished	by	legitimate	 actors	and	generally	degrades	the	marine	environment	producing	a	vicious	circle	which	further	 reduces	fish	populations.		 FAO10	estimated	that	over	500	million	people	in	developing	countries	depend	directly	or	indirectly	on	 fisheries	and	aquaculture	for	their	livelihoods	hence	failures	in	the	inclusivity	impermeability	and	 verifiability	of	the	countries	traceability	systems	has	direct	impact	in	the	small	scale	sector.		 5.2.2 Role	of	RFMOs	 Unfortunately	none	of	the	reports	provides	tangible	information	in	regards	the	mechanisms	of	the	 country	in	function	of	established	RFMOs	lead	CDS.	Many	quoted	their	adherence	to	principles	by	ROs	 and	IOs	such	as	FAO	CARICOM	and	OLDEPESCA	confusing	the	concepts	of	ROs	IOs	RFBs	and	RFMOs.	 RFMOs	per	se	have	been	actively	dealing	with	primary	and	secondary	objectives	of	their	CDS.	There	are	 many	sources	of	information	about	the	various	trade	and	CDS	currently	in	place	by	RFMOS11	i.e.	those	 established	by	the	Convention	on	the	Conservation	of	Antarctic	Marine	Living	Resources	(CCAMLR)	 Commission	for	the	Conservation	of	Southern	Bluefin	Tuna	(CCSBT)	the	Inter-American	Tropical	Tuna	 Commission	(IATTC)	International	Commission	for	the	Conservation	of	Atlantic	Tunas	(ICCAT)	and	the	 Indian	Ocean	Tuna	Commission	(IOTC)	and	while	the	EU	regulation	to	prevent	deter	and	eliminate	IUU	 fishing	could	be	functionally	included	it	is	not	a	RFMO	but	rather	a	market	access	condition	by	a	trading	 block.	 A	country	that	is	a	member	of	any	of	these	RFMOs	should	comply	with	their	requirements;	hence	when	 applicable	this	could	be	extended	into	the	domestic	market.	Nevertheless	most	of	these	RFMO	lead	 CDS	are	species	specific	oriented	towards	international	trade	and	are	not	fully	harmonized.		 Hence	the	role	of	RFMOs	in	the	internal	traceability	of	a	country	is	at	best	limited	with	the	introduction	 of	electronic	document	systems	in	many	aspects	of	international	trade	including	some	of	the	RFMO	 schemes	themselves.	Member	countries	could	use	the	platforms	available	as	a	based	to	develop	their	 own	systems	in	a	way	that	is	compatible	to	the	needs	of	the	RFMO.	 One	of	the	benefits	of	electronic	document	schemes	is	that	if	common	information	standards	can	be	 agreed	amongst	countries	and	RFMOs	data	from	a	variety	of	paper	formats	can	be	held	in	a	single	 database	format	common	to	all	requirements.	As	a	result	the	need	for	format	standardisation	has	been	 eclipsed	by	the	need	for	consistency	and	compatibility	of	information	across	schemes.		 ROs	and	IOs	on	the	other	side	could	play	a	more	vital	role	in	the	development	and	standardization	of	 compatible	traceability	systems	among	its	members.	Furthermore	the	development	costs	on	any	 system	would	be	greater	reduced	is	shared	among	many	countries.		 6 Discussion	 Is	not	the	aim	of	this	study	to	list	the	many	and	varied	advantages	that	effective	traceability	systems	 provide	to	a	country.	Boyle	(2012)	from	a	generic	point	of	view	resumes	it	in	a	simple	way;	�If	seafood	 is	not	fully	traceable	it	is	difficult	to	recall	a	product	lot	when	it	is	found	to	be	unsafe	to	eat	impossible	to	 																																								 																				 10 	http://www.fao.org/climatechange/17792-0d5738fda3c03582617e6008210ab1e3a.pdf		 11 	Joint	Tuna	RFMOs.	2009	http://www.tuna-org.org/Documents/TRFMO2/16%20ANNEX%205.8%20ENG.pdf		 	 	 34	 prove	it	is	from	legal	sources	if	it	is	accurately	labelled	from	sources	that	meet	social	and	human	rights	 standards	or	meets	the	sustainable	sourcing	commitment�.	 There	are	various	issues	raised	by	this	analysis	that	require	warrant	further	discussion	by	FAO	and	the	 participant	countries.	Among	these	this	study	focuses	on	the	following.	 6.1 Assessment	of	traceability	systems	 From	the	cases	where	the	reports	included	data	relevant	for	this	analysis	the	authors	can	say	that	it	 seems	that	the	traceability	systems	of	the	10	countries	were	designed	for	export	purposes	and	not	for	 internal	purposes.	This	might	indicated	that	the	drivers	for	traceability	(e.g.	human	safety	security	 environmental	documentation	quality	assurance)	are	not	strong	at	internal	level.	 The	main	cause	for	the	reports	not	providing	the	necessary	data	for	this	analysis	seems	to	be	the	nonoperational	and	non-standardized	specification	of	the	objective	of	these	reports.	As	discussed	in	Section	 4.1.1	even	though	traceability	is	considered	a	good	tool	for	risk	management	in	production	chains	 agreeing	on	what	traceability	actually	is	raises	controversies	at	many	levels.	Thus	the	task	handed	in	to	 the	reports	makers	should	have	defined	exactly	what	it	is	meant	by	traceability.		 Furthermore	since	traceability	is	a	generic	tool	the	task	should	have	identified	exactly	what	kind	of	 data	should	the	authors	look	for	in	the	analysed	legislation	in	order	to	make	sure	that	these	data	are	 relevant	for	IUU	fishing	deterrence	and	prevention	as	well	as	for	food	safety/sanitary	eligibility.		 6.2 Different	authorities	 Even	if	traceability	systems	are	well	designed	and	generally	well	implemented	they	can	fail	with	lack	of	 implementation	at	a	single	step	hence	is	vital	to	have	coordination	in	between	the	different	FBOs	in	the	 production	chain	but	as	well	in	the	control	of	traceability	systems	by	the	CAs	involved.	 In	addition	this	analysis	indicates	that	the	point	�at	sea�	is	the	one	where	most	of	the	IUU	fishing	 relevant	data	is	recorded.	Besides	maybe	being	the	easiest	point	where	to	perform	this	activity	it	is	 possible	that	this	situation	is	due	to	the	traditional	view	that	monitoring	control	and	surveillance	 (including	traceability	as	a	tool	for	MSC)	is	something	that	only	happens	at	sea	a	view	that	is	sustained	 also	by	the	EU	legislation	(e.g.	the	IUU	Regulation	1005/2008	does	not	provide	clear	requirements	for	 the	�on	shore�	part	of	the	production	chain).	 The	country	analysis	section	identifies	cases	where	implementations	of	traceability	requirements	are	 driven	by	different	official	bodies	(i.e.	Health	Customs	Fisheries	etc.)	that	do	not	act	normally	in	 coordination.	This	study	recommends	any	approach	to	the	establishment	of	traceability	systems	to	be	 holistic	and	integrate	all	stakeholders	in	order	to	be	effective.	 6.3 Issues	not	requested	by	the	ToRs	 While	not	requested	by	the	ToRs	the	authors	will	like	to	highlight	the	following	issues	that	are	in	their	 view	considered	important	in	terms	of	developing	effective	traceability	systems.	 6.3.1 National	and	cross-countries	traceability	 A	further	topic	of	importance	which	had	minimal	cover	in	the	reports	is	the	integration	in	regards	to	 cross-countries	(in	between	countries)	and	national	(inside	the	country)	traceability	particularly	in	the	 light	of	many	countries	with	excess	processing	capacity	and	low	labour	cost	that	import	fish	and	fishery	 products	for	further	processing	and	re-exports	(such	as	China	Vietnam	and	Thailand	for	example).		 National	traceability	is	organised	by	national	administrations	and	governed	by	national	laws.	While	 many	countries	require	one-step	forward	/	one-step	backward	traceability	requirements	associated	to	 an	export	market	and	enforce	it	with	a	varied	degree	of	effectiveness	few	to	none	provide	electronic	 traceability	systems	where	specific	types	of	products	(e.g.	fish	covered	by	an	RFMO	CDS)	are	 electronically	traced	through	the	entire	national	supply	chain	from	point	of	landing/import	to	point	of	 export/re-export.	 The	cross-countries	traceability	(in	between	countries)	stops	at	the	point	of	entry	into	a	country	and	re	 	 35	 starts	at	its	point	of	exit.	This	is	different	to	the	�first	point	of	sale�	in	an	import	market.	If	a	product	 does	not	re-emerge	as	an	export	following	landing	or	import	it	is	deemed	to	have	gone	into	domestic	 consumption.	 This	coherence	is	to	be	incorporated	into	the	traceability	systems	design	as	to	accommodate	the	 realities	those	in	many	countries	the	largest	importers	of	fish	raw	materials	are	not	processors	but	 diversified	import�export	companies.	These	companies	are	sometimes	servicing	a	variety	of	industries	 such	as	textiles	and	machinery	and	often	supply	to	and	distribute	fish	on	behalf	of	large	and	probably	 small	re-processors.	Although	this	service	comes	at	a	price	it	may	offer	essential	flexibility	in	the	 dynamic	channelling	of	raw	material	to	a	network	of	factories	as	market	conditions	change.	Although	 this	situation	is	perfectly	legal	the	fact	that	fish	may	change	hands	one	or	more	times	while	in	the	 country	has	implications	from	the	traceability	systems	perspective.	 6.3.2 Information	management	systems	 The	analysed	reports	inform	on	a	mixture	of	mostly	paper-based	systems	with	some	more	advances	 systems	in	terms	of	electronic/information	management.		Good	information	managements	tool	are	 increasingly	the	norm	in	terms	of	managing	traceability	systems.		Nevertheless	while	traceability	 systems	can	also	use	information	system	technologies	for	electronic	data	entry	and	database	 management	services	just	having	an	information	system	would	not	be	sufficient	to	establish	a	 traceability	system.	 Various	commercially	available	platforms	that	allow	for	customization	or	benchmark	for	further	 development	exist	presently.	Their	entry	cost	reduces	as	their	capacity	expands	hence	the	cost	 effectiveness	if	incorporating	informatics	into	traceability	systems	is	in	most	cases	substantial.		 Hence	new	integrated	approach	is	ought	to	be	developed	on	the	basis	of	an	electronic	traceability	 system	consisting	of	a	centralised	database	with	multiple	user	logons.	Existing	traceability	systems	 ought	to	migrate	to	such	an	electronic	platform	in	order	to	reduce	the	operational	and	administrative	 burden	to	an	absolute	minimum	and	improve	the	quality	and	utility	of	the	generated	data	towards	the	 objectives	of	the	system	and	its	connectivity	and	integration	with	other	systems.	 7 Conclusions	 Traceability	is	not	a	trivial	term	and	the	systematic	analysis	of	the	10	country	reports	shows	that	there	 is	a	lot	of	confusion	and	inconsistencies	in	the	meaning	scope	legal	status	implementation	capacity	 and	control	of	traceability	systems.		 Traceability	systems	implementation	was	catalysed	by	market	access	requirements;	which	initially	were	 the	domain	of	the	EU	health	certification	and	later	on	(after	2010)	supplemented	by	the	EU	catch	 certification.	However	most	of	the	countries	analysed	have	not	legislated	and	standardised	traceability	 as	a	requirement.	Furthermore	there	seems	to	be	little	interaction	in	between	the	health	CA	and	the	 fisheries	CA	in	terms	of	their	assessment.		 Furthermore	the	exercises	aimed	to	evaluate	traceability	systems	should	identify	exactly	what	kind	of	 data	should	the	authors	look	for	in	the	practices	along	the	production	chain	and	the	analysed	legislation	 in	order	to	make	sure	that	these	data	are	relevant	towards	the	outcomes	of	the	exercises.	 It	seems	that	efforts	towards	the	implementation	of	traceability	systems	in	the	analysed	countries	and	 across	countries	have	not	been	supported	in	an	interdisciplinary	and	standardised	way.	Ensuring	 traceability	through	the	seafood	production	chain	can	be	accomplished	by	careful	planning	taking	the	 time	to	gain	consensus	among	the	operators	and	authorities.	In	order	to	gain	trust	the	traceability	 system	in	place	must	meet	the	set	standards.		 Traceability	per	se	is	difficult	to	achieve	with	little	money	little	human	resources	and	lack	of	political	 will.	It	would	be	good	if	smaller	steps	are	taken	steps	that	together	will	lead	to	implementing	at	the	 end	effective	traceability:	clear	definition	of	traceability	in	respective	legislation	implementation	of	 traceability	requirements	within	companies	and	afterwards	between	companies	following	in	the	 beginning	the	one-step-up	one-step-down	approach	and	afterwards	moving	to	the	integrated	 	 	 36	 approach.	These	initial	steps	should	be	defined	by	risk	and	start	with	the	fisheries	with	higher	IUU	 fishing	and	food	safety	risk	profiles	but	in	a	holistic	way	so	that	other	fisheries	can	be	incorporated	in	 the	systems	at	a	later	point.		 The	authors	of	this	study	believe	that	FAO	as	in	other	aspect	of	fisheries	and	seafood	production	in	its	 unique	position	can	lead	this	standardization	efforts	by	expanding	on	the	work	initiated	by	the	�Draft	 Best	Practice	Guidelines	on	Traceability�12	as	requested	by	the	thirteenth	session	of	the	Sub-Committee	 on	Fish	Trade	(COFI:FT)	in	Bergen	Norway	24�28	February	2014.		 As	the	Sub	Committee	was	requested	to	provide	guidance	on	how	the	Secretariat	should	proceed	with	 work	on	developing	best	practice	guidelines	for	traceability	the	findings	and	recommendations	of	this	 studies	will	complement	the	work	to	be	done.	 The	authors	of	this	report	support	the	proposition	that	FAO	should	convene	an	expert	consultation	 which	would	benefit	from	the	findings	of	this	report	and	include	international	experts	on	traceability	 from	all	geographical	regions	as	well	as	representatives	of	the	various	stakeholders	along	the	seafood	 supply	chain	as	to	provide	not	only	a	set	of	guidelines	on	how	to	implement	traceability	systems	but	 equally	importantly	how	to	evaluate	them.	 8 Recommendations	 The	authors	of	this	study	provide	two	sets	of	recommendations:	one	for	FAO	and	one	for	the	10	 countries	the	analysed	reports	referred	to.	 8.1 Recommendations	to	FAO	 1.

Seafood traceability systems: gap analysis of inconsistencies in standards and norms by Melania Borit and Peter Olsen. Fisheries and Aquaculture Circular No. 1123. Rome Italy. ABSTRACT FAO member countries requested a study on gap analysis of seafood traceability systems and stipulated the parameters in paragraph 38 of the Report of the thirteenth session of the Sub-Committee on Fish Trade (COFI:FT) held in Hyderabad India in February 2012. This research was completed by two expert consultants and initially presented as an Information Note to the fifteenth session of COFI:FT in Agadir Morocco in February 2016. The report identifies and analyses gaps and inconsistencies in the current traceability standards and regulations worldwide taking into account the following traceability specifications requested by member countries namely: (i) how the integrity of product tracking is maintained; (ii) special consideration for developing countries and small-scale fisheries; (iii) the notion of equivalency; and (iv) the notion of harmonization. The key terms in understanding the concept of traceability are explained. The authors note that previous analysis of seafood traceability practices identified three main categories of traceability standards and regulations that this analysis follows: international standards and guidelines; regulatory standards and industry and NGO non-regulatory standards. This analysis employs a multi-methods approach from a multi- and interdisciplinary perspective which involves the following steps: (i) conceptualization of key terms; (ii) a comprehensive literature review; (iii) a gap analysis; and (iv) a content analysis. According to the authors seafood traceability approaches remain underdeveloped and fractured across geographies jurisdictions and market sectors. The gaps in seafood traceability systems identified in this analysis are: awareness commitment implementation technology and standards. The authors include recommendations on how to address each of these traceability gaps. v CONTENTS  Preparation of this document iii Abstract iv Abbreviations and acronyms vi Executive Summary vii  1.

As a first step in reaching this goal the key terms in understanding the concept of traceability were explained (e.g. granularity transformations referential integrity) which was described in connection with related notions (e.g. traceability systems transparency analytical methods).The second step consisted in performing a comprehensive literature review that served as a basis for building the gap analysis of the traceability standards and regulations. The last step consisted in performing a content analysis of selected international standards and guidelines regulatory standards and industry and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) non-regulatory standards. By employing this multi-method analysis several awareness commitment implementation technology and standards gaps were identified and described. In addition specific inconsistencies of inter- and intra-institutions were highlighted. Recommendations discussed include: ? Increase awareness of what traceability is how it is different from other similar concepts how traceability may add value to a company and a business. ? Develop a self-assessment scheme for seafood traceability where the advantages and disadvantages of each alternative are clearly spelled out and recommendations are made concerning which selections belong together. ? Raise awareness about the utility of using standards. ? Support various levels of complexity and allow a certain degree of variety and of freedom of choice with respect to implementing traceability. 1 1. BACKGROUND During the Fourteenth Session of the FAO Sub-Committee on Fish Trade (COFI:FT) held in Bergen Norway in February 2014 the member countries requested further work on the analysis of current traceability practices namely a gap analysis of seafood traceability systems. This study builds on this request and is in line with the COFI:FT terms of references:  ? provides a brief overview of existing traceability standards and regulations as summarized in Andre (2013); ? provides detailed identification of gaps and inconsistencies in the current standards and regulations taking into consideration the following traceability specifications: o how the integrity of product tracking is maintained; o special consideration for developing countries and small-scale fisheries; o the notion of equivalency; o the notion of harmonization; ? includes practical recommendations for improving transparency and standardization of seafood traceability systems to reduce costs in the international marketplace especially for developing countries and economies-in-transition seeking market access.  Section 2 explains the methodology followed by this study and Section 3 defines the core concepts used here. Section 4 briefly describes the international standards and guidelines regulatory standards and industry and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) non-regulatory standards included in the analysis. Section 5 presents the results of the gap analysis. Following the concluding remarks in Section 6 recommendations are made in Section 7.   2 2. METHODOLOGY 2.1. General considerations To address the complexity of its aims this study employed a multi-methods approach from a multi- and interdisciplinary perspective which involved the following steps:  1. Conceptualization of key terms; 2. A comprehensive literature review; 3. A gap analysis of the traceability standards and regulations; 4. A content analysis of selected international standards and guidelines regulatory standards and industry and NGO non-regulatory standards. 2.2. Gap analysis 2.2.1. Concept types of gaps and approach of this study A gap analysis determines the space between where something is and where it is desired to be. It serves as a means to bridge this space by identifying what has to be done in order to reach this desired state and how to do this is part of this analysis (see Figure 1) (Gomm and Brocks 2009). At the same time gap analysis can be used to compare a process product or service to another or to specified standards.  Figure 1. The gap analysis concept  Source: Upadhye (2002).   3 The literature identifies six general fields where gaps might appear (each of these fields corresponds to a type of gap) (Gomm and Brocks 2009; Chituc Toscano and Azevedo 2008):  1. Awareness: Stakeholders must be concerned about and have a well-informed interest in a particular situation or development e.g. the advantages of traceability systems. 2. Knowledge/research: Stakeholders must have the right facts and information about the particular situation or development e.g. what information should be recorded by a traceability system in order to deter illegal unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing. 3. Implementation: The principles of traceability and traceability systems are of value if they are implemented effectively through standards and norms. 4. Commitment: The traceability standards and norms must be used by the policy-makers and industry and not circumvented. This is closely related to point 1 above. 5. Technology: Tools and operational infrastructures supporting effective traceability are currently available. This is closely related to point 3 above. 6. Standards: Standards for both implementation and certification of traceability are available and accepted and terms and concepts are harmonized. This is closely related to point 3 above.  Inconsistency is a concept that is closely related to the concept of gap and refers to a lack of harmony between different parts or elements and self-contradiction. In this study we are referring to regulatory inconsistency.  This study:  ? examines the current state of approaches to traceability as indicated by the existing traceability standards and regulations versus an ideal approach based on the most relevant definition of traceability for the food domain; ? describes the gaps and inconsistencies between the standards and norms included in the analysis.  2.2.2. Literature review A systematic literature review was performed in order to identify scientific papers analysing the gaps and inconsistencies in traceability standards and norms. Databases searched included Scopus and searches were conducted in all fields up to 1 November 2015 with the earliest year being 1960. Three concepts were used to structure the search query including: seafood traceability and gap (keywords: gap* *consisten* [in/consistent/cy]). No limits were placed on year of publication or country; however only English language papers were included. Studies were initially screened for relevance to the review topic. Records were excluded if they did not specifically investigate or refer to gaps and inconsistencies in the current seafood traceability standards and norms. The records identified through this technique were supplemented through snowball sampling of relevant sources. The screening process is summarized in Figure 2.   4 Figure 2.

THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK 3.1. Traceability and traceability systems 3.1.1. Traceability concept terms and definitions The following constitutes a short but by no means exhaustive primer on traceability terms and concepts. There are conflicting or ambiguous views on or definitions of some of these terms; efforts have been made to choose the definitions most consistent with normal practice in the captured fish industry and also most suitable for the analysis in this study.  3.1.1.1. Batch  A common dictionary definition of �batch� or �lot� is �the quantity of material prepared or required for one operation� (Farlex 2015). In seafood supply chains the following common terms are used: �raw material batches� (the fish component) �ingredient batches� (other components) and �production batches�. �Batch� is an internal term for a given company; batch identifiers are often locally generated in the company and do not normally adhere to any standards. Batches are not necessarily explicitly labelled or identified in the company provided that the company knows what constitutes a given batch (see Figure 3).  3.1.1.2. Trade unit  Trade Unit (TU) or Trade Item is a quantity of material (e.g. fish product) that is sold by one trading partner to another. Incoming TUs are often merged or mixed into raw material or ingredient batches e.g. when captured fish is sorted by size and quality before processing. Production batches are typically large (everything that is produced of one product type in one unit of time typically a day or a shift is common practice for production batches) and are normally split into numerous outgoing TUs. TUs must be explicitly labelled and identified by the producing/selling company so that the receiving/buying company can identify the content. It is not uncommon for TUs to be identified by the (production) batch number they belong to. This makes traceability more difficult and less effective because numerous trade units will then have the same identifier. Unique identification of TUs requires more work but it makes traceability easier and is becoming more common in companies with effective traceability systems (see Figure 3).   6 Figure 3. Example of batches and trade units in the supply chain of a company  Source: TraceFood (2008).  3.1.1.3. Traceable resource unit  A traceable resource unit is �the unit that one wants to trace� or �the unit that one records information on in a traceability system�. Here traceable resource unit (TRU) is a common term used for all types of batches and TUs.  3.1.1.4. Granularity Granularity depends on the physical size of the TRU; the smaller the TRU the smaller the granularity. When implementing a traceability system companies must decide on the granularity they want. A fish processing company can typically choose whether they assign a new production batch number every day every shift (e.g. 2-3 times per day) or every time they change raw materials (e.g. 1-20 times per day). The lower the granularity the more TRUs they will have the more work will be involved and the more accurate the traceability system will be. Granularity can be a particularly important consideration when planning for potential product recalls; the larger the granularity the more products will have to be recalled if anything goes wrong.  3.1.1.5. TRU identifiers and uniqueness TRUs are given identifiers in the form of numeric or alphanumeric codes. These identifiers are either assigned by the company that generates the TRU or are mutually agreed between trading partners often with reference to standards. The identifiers must be unique in their context so that there is no risk of the same identifier accidently being assigned twice. Ensuring uniqueness internally in a company is not too difficult; most companies have defined some coding schemes (normally used on batches) that ensure that within that company the same identifier is not used twice. Ensuring uniqueness when many trading partners are involved (typically for TUs) is more difficult; often the most convenient solution is to use globally unique identifiers which are often constructed by combining country codes with company codes that are unique within the country in question and using this number as a prefix for the companyspecific codes. 7 3.1.1.6. Referential integrity While the TRU must be unique within its context practice differs in relation to whether this unique identifier can only be assigned to one TRU or whether the same unique identifier can be applied to multiple TRUs. The first practice is referred to as �referential integrity� or the licence plate (or person number) principle. If referential integrity is present then each TRU will have its own unique identifier not to be shared with any other TRUs. If referential integrity is absent this will limit the effectiveness of the traceability system. Even if the identifier �B12345� is unique in a given context and has a number of properties associated with it (e.g. vessel name catch date production date) referential integrity is lost if that same identifier is used for more than one TRU. While all of these TRUs will still have the original set of properties in common (e.g. they all came from the same vessel and were caught and processed on the same dates) it is not possible to distinguish between TRUs nor to record further properties related to each TRU (e.g. date/time and location date/time and temperature). It is not uncommon in the captured fish industry to use the internal production batch number as the identifier for each TU that is generated and sold; however this does not provide referential integrity. Traceability systems that are not based on referential integrity may be simpler (shorter codes) and cheaper (less generation of codes less reading of codes) but they will inherently suffer from the limitations indicated and there will be numerous potentially relevant TRU properties that these systems can never keep track of.  3.1.1.7. Transformation New batches and new TUs are created at specific times typically when fish are caught or received when processes generate products in a given time period or when existing TRUs are split up or joined together (Figure 4). When new TRUs are generated based on existing ones this is called a �transformation�; typical transformation types are merges splits and mixes. To document a transformation one needs to document exactly which existing batches or TUs were used to create a new batch or TU; often it is also relevant to record the amounts or percentages used. Trade units are often smaller than the internal batches; i.e. received TUs are often joined together to make raw material batches. A typical example of a transformation is when the incoming TU is �the fish of a given type bought from a given vessel at a given time� and the raw material batch is �the fish of a given type (and possibly size) used as raw material on a given day�. Another typical example of a transformation is when the production batch is �everything produced of a certain product on a certain day� and the outgoing TU is �a box or container of a certain weight generated from that production batch�.  Figure 4. Batches/trade units transformation types  Source: TraceFood (2008).  3.1.1.8. Traceability There are numerous definitions of traceability most of which are recursive in that they define traceability as �the ability to trace� without defining exactly what �trace� means in this context. An attempt to merge the best parts of various existing definitions while avoiding recursion and ambiguity was made by Olsen and Borit (2013) who defined traceability as �[t]he ability to access any or all information relating to that which is under consideration throughout its entire life cycle by means of recorded identifications�. This emphasizes that any information can be traced that traceability applies 8 to any sort of object or item in any part of the life cycle and that recorded identifications need to be involved. The latter requirement is important with respect to differentiating between traceability and traceability control mechanisms; i.e. methods and instruments that measure biochemical properties of the food product and used for authentication and testing whether what is received is what is indicated in the documentation.  Traceability depends on recording all transformations in the chain explicitly or implicitly. If all transformations are recorded one can always trace back or forward from any given TRU to any other one that comes from (or may have come from) the same origin or process. In addition traceability requires relevant information to be recorded and associated with every TRU in the supply chain so that not only can one find where a given TRU came from (the �ancestors�) or went to (�the progeny�) but also the properties of all of these TRUs (when and where was it created weight or volume what form is it in what species fat content salt content etc.).  3.1.1.9. Internal traceability Internal traceability is the traceability within a link or a company (Figure 5). On a fishing vessel the first step is recording information related to the catch; in the other links the first step is recording information related to the received TUs. Subsequently information on all the other internal steps must be recorded including all transformations that take place and all relevant properties related to internally generated batches or TUs. Internal traceability is the backbone of traceability; all else depends on each company in the chain having good systems and good practices with regard to recording all the relevant internal information. Internal traceability mainly deals with batches but the relationship between incoming TUs and raw material (or ingredient) batches must be recorded as well as the relationship between production batches and outgoing TUs. Internal traceability is the domain and responsibility of a single company; data confidentiality or access is not a major issue; and several good systems solutions practices and standards have been developed in this area.  3.1.1.10. Chain Chain traceability is the traceability between links and companies and it depends on the data recorded in the internal traceability system being transmitted and then read and understood in the next link in the chain (Figure 5). Data can be transmitted in various ways; the simplest being by physically (on the label) or logically (in accompanying documentation) attaching the information to the product when it is sent. A more flexible way of implementing chain traceability is for trading partners to agree on how to identify the TUs and then send the required information through another channel (fax mail through electronically integrated systems) while referring to the TU in question. This is commonly referred to as �information push�; as the amount of data grows ever larger the �information pull� also gains popularity as a way of implementing chain traceability. This occurs when the trading partners agree that the seller should retain and make available information on request about the TU in question; the request could be submitted by telephone or fax but in modern electronic systems this functionality is typically accomplished by trading partners sharing an intranet where the supplier provides detailed data on all TUs and the buyer can extract whatever data is needed. Chain traceability is much more complex to achieve because it requires the cooperation and agreement between at least two (in practice more) companies and data confidentiality and levels of access are a major issue. Chain traceability is often closely related to Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) which in turn depends heavily on the agreement on and adoption of standards with respect to media identifiers content and structure of the data that are to be exchanged.   9 Figure 5. Internal versus chain traceability  Source: TraceFood (2008).  3.1.2. Traceability systems Traceability systems are constructions that enable traceability; they can be paper-based but more and more commonly they are computer-based. Specialty literature contains several detailed descriptions of traceability systems in various food sectors and there seems to be a general agreement over what properties these traceability systems could or should have (Olsen and Borit 2013; Mgonja Luning and Van der Vorst 2013). Specialty literature underlines that a traceability system for food products should be able to: ? provide access to all properties of a food product not only those that can be verified analytically; ? provide access to the properties of a food product or ingredient in all its forms in all the links in the supply chain not only on production batch level; ? facilitate traceability both backwards (where did the food product come from?) and forwards (where did it go?) (Olsen and Borit 2013).  To achieve the above traceability must be based on systematic recordings and their exchange; there are many relevant properties that will be lost if there is no record-keeping system and a means of distributing/sharing the information. In practice a unit identification system or numbering scheme must be present; without it one cannot achieve several of the goals listed above. Accordingly as indicated by Olsen and Borit (2013) in a supply chain a traceability system must have the following properties:  1. Ingredients and raw materials must somehow be grouped into units with similar properties what Moe (1998) and Kim Fox and Gr�ninger (1999) refer to as �traceable resource units�. 2. Identifiers/keys must be assigned to these units. Ideally these identifiers should be globally unique and never reused but in practice traceability in the food industry depends on identifiers that are only unique within a given context (typically they are unique for a given day�s production of a given product type for a given company). Expanding on this issue is beyond the scope of this paper; see Karlsen Donnelly and Olsen (2011) for a more detailed discussion. 3. Product and process properties must be recorded and either directly or indirectly (for instance through a time stamp) linked to these identifiers. 4. A mechanism must exist to get access to these properties.  10 Granularity and whether to have referential integrity or not are important aspects when implementing point 2 above. The recordings mentioned in point 3 must include the documentation of transformations; i.e. the recording of exactly which previous TRUs were used to construct this one (and which subsequent TRUs this TRU in turn became part of). If the transformations are not recorded it will not be possible to track the TRU along the entire supply chain and an important aspect of traceability is lost. The mechanism mentioned in point 4 depends on whether it is a company or a chain. A company has an internal traceability system; often software with ample opportunity for browsing data visualizing dependencies (which TRUs were based on which TRUs) and creating reports. Acquiring such functionality for a whole supply chain is the major challenge and requires effort motivation and cooperation in addition to the presence of technical solutions that build on well-proven and widely adopted standards. Verification and validation of the data in the traceability system is also very important but these are external processes and not part of the traceability system.  3.1.3. Drivers of traceability systems Not all traceability systems are equivalent and/or interchangeable nor can they necessarily be consolidated. Different purposes/drivers also trigger different expectations in producers and consumers that do not always correspond to the traceability system in use (regulatory contractual or voluntary) (Borit 2009). Table 1 summarizes different characteristics of traceability systems including drivers for implementing them.  Table 1.

Traceability and transparency  As indicated in the specialty literature being directly linked to trust building among stakeholders transparency is a critical element in risk communication (Hofstede 2004; Renn 2008). Transparency of a supply chain is the degree of shared understanding of and access to product-related information as requested by a supply chain�s stakeholders without loss noise delay or distortion (Hofstede 2004). However transparency and traceability are not the same because the latter only sets the framework for the former (Egels-Zand�n Hulth�n and Wulff 2014). Depending on whether transparency is aimed at the past present or future it can be divided in three types: history operations and strategy transparency (Hofstede 2004). With respect to products traceability can enable the first two types of transparency because it addresses the past and the present of the product (Borit 2016). A good traceability system can provide product-related information to stakeholders with little loss noise or delay but with respect to distortion it must be recalled that a traceability system basically contains mostly unverified claims and to ensure transparency data verification mechanisms are also needed. A traceability system can provide a coherent overview of all the raw materials ingredients transformations processes and products in the supply chain and one cannot really have transparency without traceability but for transparency some other components are also needed. This is related to the fact that the concept of traceability is rather generic and could be summarized as �keep a record of what you are doing in the chain� whereas transparency has a specific application and target audience in mind. One measure to improve transparency is to establish or identify authoritative data sources including a global record of fishing vessels (Expert Panel on Legal and Traceable Wild Fish Products 2015).  3.1.5. Traceability and chain of custody In the context of documenting fish products FAO defines chain of custody (CoC) as:  The set of measures which is designed to guarantee that the product put on the market and bearing the ecolabel logo is really a product coming from the certified fishery concerned. These measures should thus cover both the tracking/traceability of the product all along the processing distribution and marketing chain as well as the proper tracking of the documentation (and control of the quantity concerned) (FAO 2009a).  Hence while traceability and CoC to some degree have the same goal (well-documented fish products) their approach is rather different.  Traceability is generic and non-discriminatory; the company receives TUs (or fish from the ocean where the catch is identified in a similar way as a TU) splits joins or merges TUs into raw material batches (e.g. by grading) makes production batches based on the raw material batches and finally splits the production batches into outgoing TUs. At each stage a spilt join or merge can take place which will be recorded in the traceability system so that all transformations and dependencies are documented. The golden rule in a traceability system is that �you can do �anything� (as far as the traceability system is concerned) but you must document what you are doing�.  With ecolabel type CoC there is one particular set of properties that it is desired to protect retain and document (e.g. ecolabels such as dolphin-safe; organic) while other sets are not given importance. The ecolabel in question will normally provide the list of required values for the properties in question (e.g. a given species a given gear type a given area or fishery documentation of various aspects of sustainability) and also assign the CoC identifier. This CoC identifier applies to all fish products produced by a company that satisfy the given set of properties which may include fish from different vessels caught on different days. The golden rule in a CoC system is that �you can only mix units that have the same CoC number and if you do so the CoC number is retained�.   13 The main differences between traceability and CoC are summarized in Table 2. In theory the two terms might mean very much the same thing but in practice in the fish industry there is a difference between traceability and ecolabel type CoC (Borit and Olsen 2012) as outlined above.  Table 2. Main differences between traceability and chain of custody  Traceability Ecolabel type chain of custody (CoC) Of what? Anything With respect to some property Unit with integrity The trade unit The units with the same CoC identifier Mix/join units Must document Only with the same CoC identifier After mix / join New unit and new identifier created Considered same unit CoC identifier  Certification is the procedure by which a certification body gives written or equivalent assurance that a product process or service conforms to certain standards (FAO 2009b). While being two different processes traceability can be used as a tool in the certification process. Documentation of CoC is part of what is required for certification especially certification related to use of ecolabels.  3.1.6. Traceability and catch/trade documentation schemes The definition chosen for traceability in this study is �[T]he ability to access any or all information relating to that which is under consideration throughout its entire life cycle by means of recorded identifications� (Olsen and Borit2013). There are numerous mandatory and voluntary catch/trade documentations schemes (CTDSs) in use around the world and while they have properties in common with a traceability system they do not in themselves constitute traceability systems. CTDSs do involve some very relevant recorded identifications but the set of recorded data is limited and often selected for one purpose only (e.g. customs control document legal provenance of captured fish). In addition CTDSs do not apply throughout the entire life cycle of the product in question. A traceability system is �live� in that one can keep adding data on TRUs as long as they exist; a CTDS provides snapshots of a subset of the information at a certain time and place � typically when first- hand sale is conducted or when the product passes a border. Indeed CTDSs are important in relation to traceability. First an efficient traceability system will to a large degree automate the generation of the CTDS when needed hence time and effort related to the production of the CTDS can be significantly reduced for companies with efficient traceability systems and this in turn provides a driver for investing in traceability. Second the information on the CTDS can serve as input to traceability systems that receive the product in question and its data will be in standard format and often be mandatory which in turn improves the quality of the data available later on in the chain.  3.1.7. Traceability and analytical methods Currently there are a multitude of analytical methods and instruments in use to measure certain physical and biochemical properties of food products such as DNA fingerprinting (Ogden 2008) spectroscopy (Ottavian et al. 2012) and magnetic resonance (Masoum et al. 2007). These analytical methods do not provide traceability; practically all definitions of traceability (including the one chosen in this study) indicate that traceability must entail some historical record keeping. While analytical methods only provide instantaneous measurements some of these measurements can indeed provide useful and relevant information about the product and process history. Most of the data in a traceability system can be considered to be claims most of which have no inherent verification connected to them beyond the fact that someone somewhere in the supply chain once entered the data value and implicitly claimed it to be a true property of the TRU in question. However false claims do occur both because of errors and because of deliberate fraud often for economic reasons. Analytical methods are essential with respect to verifying (or falsifying) claims in the traceability systems especially if a dispute or a court case is involved as is frequently the case after food safety incidents. While analytical methods can be very useful there are many relevant food product properties that cannot be analytically verified especially in the captured fish industry. These include properties such as the identity of the food business operator 14 or owner at various stages in the chain processing conditions that did not directly influence the food properties data on yield and economics as well as properties relating to ethics sustainability and legality (Olsen and Borit 2013). To verify claims and to detect fraud in these areas paper-trail-based methods are needed; the most common are mass balance accounting which detects unusual claims in relation to yield for a given process) and input-output analysis which detects the mismatch between output stated in one place and corresponding input stated in another place.  3.1.8. Traceability and data validation and verification Contrary to popular belief traceability is not a method to ensure that information about a certain product is true or accurate (Borit 2016). Traceability can be imagined as an infrastructure that can be used by control agencies for retrieving different data for various reasons (e.g. quality assurance) or for verifying these data with their specific means (e.g. genetic identification of species) (Borit and Santos 2015). As previously mentioned in the specialty literature �A traceability system is quite similar to a filing cabinet in that they both deal with systematic storing and retrieving of data. Importantly neither a traceability system nor a filing cabinet care about what types of data are being stored� (Olsen and Borit 2013). Fraud and error can falsify recordings or render them incomplete; thus the need to verify these claims becomes obvious. Here together with comprehensive inspections and certification analytical methods play an important role (Kelly et al. 2011).  3.2. Harmonization and standardization Standards are closely connected to chain traceability because the latter requires trading partners to exchange a large amount of information. Unless the partners agree in great detail about what everything means and how it should be structured and represented information loss is bound to occur. It would not make sense for two trading partners to establish their own specifications for exchanging information because of the unnecessary work involved and because they both would have numerous suppliers and customers. Making separate agreements with all of them would not be feasible. In principle the internal traceability in a company can be effective without resorting to standards but it is the recording in the internal traceability system that provides the data that are exchanged in the chain traceability system which must be in standard format if the trading partner is to understand them.  To support the data interchanges that chain traceability builds on standards are needed on many levels:  ? TRU identification. All TRU identifiers must be unique within the given context and if the given context involves several companies and countries the best way to ensure uniqueness is to use an internationally agreed upon standard for generating globally unique TRU identifiers. GS1 is the most relevant organization for unique identifiers on a global level in general but there are also other alternatives. ? Physical media for codes and numbers especially on labels. In addition to the obvious �clear text� option there are among others bar codes two-dimensional bar codes QR-codes and radio-frequency identification (RF-ID) tags (active and passive). The trading partners must agree on what physical media to use. The supplier must have equipment suitable for generating this media type and the buyer must have equipment and take the time needed to read these codes. Internationally agreed upon standards exist for all these media types however uptake of the more advanced technologies (RF-ID in particular) have been far slower than anticipated probably due to cost and lack of motivation in large parts of the seafood stakeholders. ? Electronic data interchange especially based on various types of eXtensible Markup Language (XML) messages. Various internationally agreed upon standards exist and their use is increasing to some degree driven by the obligatory use of similar standards in some business situations. (For example some states have made the use of these standards obligatory when submitting bids for government contracts.)  15 ? Data element names. This is an area where there have been fewer attempts at standardization; ISO 12875 and ISO 12877 are among the exceptions. Most of the electronic standards are based on XML and the �eXtensible� part of XML allows XML to be used to exchange data elements that have not been pre-defined. While this is a good and flexible approach it does not in reality facilitate traceability. When data are recorded somewhere in the seafood supply chain a value is generated (e.g. �198�) often a unit of measurement (e.g. �grams�) and these attributes are then associated with a data element name (e.g. �weight�). However transmitting the information for example that �weight is 198 g� does not in itself facilitate traceability; the recipient needs to know what this refers to the weight of what and how when and where it was measured. To facilitate efficient and errorfree communication there is clearly a need for trading partners to agree on what the data element names should be and exactly what they should refer to. This is what standards for data element names are used for; they are like commonly agreed upon dictionaries (ontologies) detailing exactly what all the terms mean and how they are interrelated.  There are a number of standards on the above levels; some for products in general others for food products and others still for seafood in particular. In addition there are implicit and explicit traceability requirements in standards and in regulation where traceability is not the main focus but rather food quality food safety food processing or similar. Ideally it can be argued that the standards should be merged or at least harmonized but in practice this is an unrealistic goal precisely because the scope of the standards varies greatly. Also the major challenge in implementing traceability is not the fact that there are overlapping or conflicting standards and that conversions are needed but rather that standards are not used (or used too little) when designing the food industry systems and practices.  According to the Expert Panel on Legal and Traceable Wild Fish Products (2015) some of the measures to maintain integrity of product tracking and for improving standardization are: the adoption of minimum information standards for wild-caught fish products; establishment of a harmonized system of �landing authorizations� to provide primary assurances of the legal origin of fish products; and the development of a global architecture for interoperability systems.  3.3. Consistency From a norms perspective �coherence� refers to �positive connections� or �the construction of a united whole� while �consistency� refers to the absence of contradiction (Hillion 2014). The latter refers to ideas of compatibility and of making good sense whereas the former relates more to synergy and added value. �Hence coherence in law would be a matter of degree whereas consistency would be a static notion in the sense that concepts of law can be more or less coherent but cannot be more or less consistent. They are either consistent or not� (ibid.). From a theoretical point of view the meaning of norms consistency has been refined as horizontal consistency and vertical consistency. The latter applies for example to the relations between the Member States and the European Union (EU) while the former focuses on implementation and refers to consistency at the EU level either inter-institutional or inter-policy (Minkova 2011). In terms of this second aspect consistency can be defined as �the way in which the substance of different policies generated by the EU forms part of whole� (Portela and Raube 2008). Nevertheless the application of the consistency principle has to be flexible enough for regulatory approaches to change due to changes in the context for example the change in the EU regulatory regime for food as a consequence of the mad cow disease (Vos 2000). Yet another important aspect is that norms are not only formulated but also applied in a consistent manner (Cody and Stretch 2014).  Building on these aspects this study uses the following concepts:  ? intra-institutional regulatory consistency which refers to the different norms generated by the same institution form part of a whole; ? inter-institutional regulatory consistency which refers to the use of similar concepts and procedures for related items by different entities in the same industry. ? application consistency which refers to the similar application of the same norms. 16  One important consequence of the lack of regulatory inter-institutional consistency is fragmentation (i.e. the increased proliferation of standards and norms with overlapping jurisdictions and ambiguous boundaries) which can lead to forum shopping (Benvenisti and Downs 2007) confusion among industry and consumers alike (Borit and Santos 2015) as well as delay in the development of valuable products and services (Mandel 2004) that could facilitate implementation of traceability. 17 4. OVERVIEW OF EXISTING TRACEABILITY STANDARDS AND REGULATIONS  Previous analysis of traceability practices (Andre 2013) identified three main categories of traceability standards and regulations that this study also follows: international standards and guidelines regulatory standards and industry and NGO non-regulatory standards. All the current traceability standards refer to implementation of traceability and none of them to certification of already implemented traceability systems.  4.1. International standards and guidelines Inter-governmental guidelines: International standards and guidelines are developed to define and/or to provide best practices in tracing food products through supply chains. This category includes standards and guidelines developed by the Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (RFMOs) and other natural resource management inter-governmental organizations in their aim to provide guidance to their member states in dealing with illegal unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing (ibid.).  4.1.1. The Codex Alimentarius The Codex Alimentarius or "Food Code" was established by FAO and the World Health Organization in 1963 to develop harmonized international food standards which protect consumer health and promote fair practices in food trade (WHO and FAO 2015). The Codex defines traceability as �the ability to follow the movement of a food through specified stage(s) of production processing and distribution� (Codex Alimentarius Commission 2006). This definition reduces traceability to following movement of food products only. The Codex Alimentarius is recognized by the World Trade Organization as an international reference point for the resolution of disputes concerning food safety and consumer protection so its traceability definition is of special importance even though it is not commonly referred to at least not in scientific articles (Olsen and Borit 2013). The Codex Alimentarius recognizes that at the international level methods are not harmonized and are often complicated thus also leading to barriers to trade (Codex Alimentarius Commission 2007). The approach to traceability taken by the Codex Alimentarius is considered insufficient by the specialty literature because it does not incorporate essential properties of traceability systems (Olsen and Borit 2013).  4.1.2. The International Office of Epizootics The International Office of Epizootics (OIE) Aquatic Animal Health Code (the �Aquatic Code�) sets standards for the improvement of aquatic animal health and welfare of farmed fish worldwide and for safe international trade in aquatic animals (amphibians crustaceans fish and molluscs) and their products. The health measures in the Aquatic Code should be used by the Competent Authorities of importing and exporting countries for early detection reporting and control of agents that are pathogenic to aquatic animals and for the prevention of their transfer via international trade in aquatic animals and their products while avoiding unjustified sanitary barriers to trade (OIE 2005). OIE supports its Member Countries and Territories in implementing animal identification and traceability systems in order to improve the effectiveness of their policies and activities relating to disease prevention and control animal production food safety and the certification of exports. The Aquatic Code emphasizes that traceability should be a demonstration of Government Veterinary Services� capacity to exercise control over all animal health matters and not a description of the responsibility of private stakeholders in the chain (Andre 2013).   18 4.1.3. FAO guidelines 4.1.3.1. Marine capture fisheries � ecolabelling  The FAO Guidelines for the ecolabelling of fish and fishery products from marine capture fisheries (2009) summarize several principles that should be observed by ecolabelling schemes. These guidelines cover the fishery management system the status of the target stock and ecosystem considerations with the overarching purpose of identifying sustainable fisheries (Andre 2013). Paragraph 16 of the Guidelines states that the CoC measures designed by the ecolabel �should cover both the tracking/traceability of the product all along the processing distribution and marketing chain as well as the proper tracking of the documentation (and control of the quantity concerned)�. However even though in theory the two terms might have the same meaning in practice in the industry there is a difference between traceability and ecolabel-type CoC.  4.1.3.2. Aquaculture � certification The FAO Technical guidelines on aquaculture certification provide guidance for the development organization and implementation of credible aquaculture certification schemes (FAO 2011). The guidelines addresses a range of issues that should be considered relevant for certification in aquaculture including: (i) animal health and welfare; (ii) food safety; (iii) environmental integrity and (iv) socio-economic aspects associated with aquaculture (Andre 2013). These guidelines state that one of the principles of aquaculture certification schemes is that they should include adequate procedures for maintaining CoC and traceability of certified aquaculture products and processes. This study has the same approach to traceability and CoC as in the ecolabelling guidelines.  4.1.4. RFMO catch/trade documentation schemes RFMOs are international organizations formed by countries with fishing interests in areas beyond national jurisdiction (ABNJs). Some of them manage all the fish stocks found in a specific area while others focus on particular highly-migratory species notably tuna throughout vast geographical areas. While some RFMOs have a purely advisory role most have management powers to set catch and fishing effort limits technical measures and control obligations (European Commission 2015). Almost all of the global high seas are now covered by at least one RFMO out of the 18 current Fisheries Management Bodies (Cullis-Suzuki and Pauly 2010). Of these five are the tuna RFMOs which manage fisheries for tuna and other large species such as swordfish and marlin (The PEW Charitable Trusts 2012). As part of their fight against IUU fishing RFMOs are using catch and trade documentation schemes. These schemes are important fisheries management tools but are not designed as traceability systems for markets/consumers (Clarke 2012). For a detailed analysis of these CTDSs and seafood traceability see MRAG (2010).  4.2. Regulations Binding norms (Andre 2013): A second category is formed by the binding norms that are set by particular countries that are broadly applicable to food products and more specifically to fish products and that are mandatory for export to the European Union (EU) the United States of America and Japan. They include laws regulations and associated enforcement programmes for traceability of fish products. These norms set the minimum traceability requirements for all trading of food products as well as fishspecific requirements focused on preventing trade in illegally caught fish (ibid.).  4.2.1. European Union (Member Organization) According to Lavelli (2013) the EU legislature works with two different models with respect to food traceability. The model implemented through the application of the General Food Law (European Commission 2002) leads to a generic (non-specific) low-warranty traceability of the EU food supply chain. A second more complex model is followed in norms regulating products such as those derived 19 from genetically modified organisms. The application of this second model leads to a specific high-warranty traceability system for any product unit in the food supply chain. In general the EU traceability systems are considered insufficient (van Ruth 2014)  According to Article 18 of the European Commission Regulation 178/2002 laying down the general principles and requirements of food law establishing the European Food Safety Authority and laying down procedures in matters of food safety (usually referred to as the General Food Law or GFL) the legal requirements rely on the �one step back � one step forward� approach to traceability. This approach implies that food business operators have to establish two types of links: a link �supplier-product� (which products supplied from which suppliers); and a link �customer-product� (which products supplied to which customers). Nevertheless operators do not have to identify the immediate customers when they are final consumers. The Regulation does not expressly constrain operators to establish a link �incoming and outgoing products� (�internal traceability�). Thus there is no requirement for records to be kept that identify how product batches are split and combined within a business to create particular products or new batches (European Commission 2010). Companies therefore have to know where the ingredients came from and where the products went but not necessarily which ingredients went into which products (Van Der Meulen and Van Der Velde 2008). Being a regulation this piece of legislation was directly applicable in the legislation of the Member States without transposition. The approach to traceability taken by the EU GFL is considered non-effective by the specialty literature (Borit and Santos 2015).  Following the principles of the FAO International Plan of Action to Prevent Deter and Eliminate Illegal Unreported and Unregulated Fishing (IPOA-IUU) in 2008 the EU adopted new fisheries regulations specifically designed to address the IUU fishing problem: the EU IUU Regulation 1005/2008 (Renn 2008) (and its Implementation Regulation 1010/2009) and the EU Control Regulation 1224/2009. Both norms sought to ensure full traceability from the fishing net to the plate of all marine fishery products. This was hoped to be achieved by means of a catch certification scheme. This approach to traceability is also considered non-effective by the specialty literature (Borit and Santos 2015).  Detailed description and analyses of the EU legislative framework related to traceability can be found in Andre (2013) Borit (2016) Borit and Olsen (2012); Borit and Santos (2015) and Charlebois et al. (2014).  4.2.2. United States of America The United States has traceability regulations pertaining to livestock identification and movement and generally lacks regulations on other agricultural commodities; however it has identification and labelling regulations on packaged food products. In 2011 as a part of the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) the United States Department of Agriculture introduced Animal Disease Traceability requirements. Despite the passage of the FSMA and the opportunity to strengthen traceability the United States still lacks regulations on national traceability of food products in general. While the new FSMA is expected to improve food traceability capabilities the development of regulations is still in the early stages (Charlebois et al. 2014). The United States federal food safety oversight is considered to be fragmented (Zach et al. 2012).  One of the latest developments in the United States regarding IUU fishing and traceability is the establishment of a Task Force to identify and develop a list of the types of information and operational standards needed for an effective seafood traceability programme to combat seafood fraud and IUU seafood in US commerce (Presidential Task Force on Combating IUU Fishing and Seafood Fraud 2014). This traceability programme will be risk-based and will be developed through �notice-andcomment rulemaking� i.e. a common rulemaking procedure under which a proposed rule is published in the Federal Register and is open to comment by the general public. This rulemaking will address data requirements the design of the programme and the species to which the first phase of the programme will be applied (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 2015).  20 A detailed description and analyses of the US legislative framework related to traceability can be found in Charlebois et al. (2014) and Andre (2013).  4.2.3. Japan Japan has established traceability systems for animals and animal products (e.g. cattle and beef) but only for a few foods and other commodities (e.g. rice) (Charlebois 2014). Guidelines for developing traceability systems are being established by industry associations rather than by national legislature. For example the Japanese Handbook for Introduction of Food Traceability Systems is a set of guidelines for the traceability of commodities such as fruits and vegetables shellfish eggs and farmed fish.  A detailed description and analyses of the Japan legislative framework related to traceability can found in Andre (2013) and Charlebois et al. (2014).  4.3. Non-regulatory standards Parallel to the above-mentioned standards and norms commercial standards have been delivered by organizations and associations to set traceability requirements facilitate data sharing and adopt product identification standards for commercial purposes (Dabbene Gay and Tortia 2014). Non-governmental/industry standards (contractual) (Andre 2013): Non-regulatory standards developed by NGOs industry and other standards such as the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) are included in a third category. This category include guidelines for auditing and other measures to ensure successful application of the standards.  4.3.1. International Organization for Standardization ISO 8402:1994 Quality management and quality assurance: This standard is considered to contain the least incomplete definition of product traceability: �[t]he ability to trace the history application or location of an entity by means of recorded identifications.� This definition clearly states what should be traced (history application and location) and how the tracing should be performed by means of recorded identifications (Olsen and Borit 2013). However this standard was superseded by ISO 9000.  ISO 9000:2000 Quality management systems ISO 22000:2005 Food safety management systems and ISO 22005:2007 Traceability in the feed and food chain ISO 12875/12877:2011 Traceability of finfish products � Specification on the information to be recorded in captured/farmed finfish distribution chains ISO 16741/18538:2015 Traceability of crustacean/molluscan products: These standards use a slightly less specific definition of traceability: �[T]he ability to trace the history application or location of that which is under consideration�. In this newer definition the fragment �by means of recorded identifications� has been removed which has consequences as explained in Olsen and Borit (2013). ISO 22005 adds: �Terms such as document traceability computer traceability or commercial traceability should be avoided.� ISO 12875/12877:2011 are generated from the TraceFish standard.  4.3.2. Industry Several industrial associations have developed their own traceability standards including: the US National Fisheries Institute; the EU Fish Processors Association and the EU Federation of National Organisations of Importers and Exporters of Fish (AIPCE-CEP); and British Retail Consortium Global Standard for Food Safety Issue 6. For a detailed description and analyses of these initiatives see Andre (2013.)   21 4.3.3. Non-governmental organizations Major leading internationally established fishery/aquaculture certification programmes (e.g. World Wildlife Fund Smart Fishing Initiative National Marine Fisheries Service Dolphin Safe Marine Stewardship Council) have developed their own certification schemes that also claim to address the traceability issue. Each set of standards has its own focus (e.g. assurance of minimal environmental impacts organic certification) and its own individual structure and presentation. For a detailed description and analyses of these initiatives see Andre (2013).   22 5. GAP ANALYSIS RESULTS 5.1. Gaps Despite the many tools and practices for seafood traceability approaches remain underdeveloped and fractured across geographies jurisdictions and market sectors (Sterling and Chiasson 2014). There are traceability-related gaps with respect to awareness commitment implementation technology and standards. Based on our gap analysis the most important are indicated below.  Awareness gaps:  ? There is a lack of understanding of what traceability is and how it differs from other concepts that are viewed to be similar e.g. CoC or catch/trade documentation schemes. ? There is a lack of understanding of how traceability can streamline companies internal processes and improve financial performance (Sterling and Chiasson 2014). ? There is a lack of understanding of the fact that many of the main obstacles for adoption of traceability in seafood chains are cultural and organizational rather than technical (ibid.). ? There is a lack of understanding of the fact that traceability needs to cover the entire seafood chains from catch or farming through all types of processing and transport all the way to the retailer and the consumer. For instance for fisheries �the gaps in the system occur at many levels: at sea where monitoring control and surveillance remain frequently inadequate; in ports where systems to document catch landings are often weak or non-transparent; and in market countries where effective systems to require traceability and proof of legal origin are lacking (Pramod 2014)�. This is connected to the lack of understanding (both at government and private sector levels) of the difference between internal traceability and chain traceability. While the former may be effective in a given company it is the chain traceability the entire supply chain and a company cannot achieve this alone. ? There is a lack of understanding (both at government and private sector levels) of the importance of documenting transformations and how the chain of transformations is essential in order to trace backward or forward to a company or through a chain of companies. This relates to the lack of understanding of the importance of referential integrity; it is much easier to document and visualize the chain of transformations if all TRUs have unique identifiers.  Commitment gaps:  The commitment gap with respect to implementing seafood traceability systems is significant and probably related to the many awareness gaps. While there are still challenges related to availability of technology solutions and standards it is clear that most companies have less traceability than they could have and also probably less traceability than they should have given their strategy their priorities and their own economic interests. In addition the most significant commitment gap is related to companies not understanding how traceability can benefit them financially. There is increasing documentation of the fact that not only can a good traceability system reduce operating costs and fulfil legislative and commercial requirements but it can also underpin company branding and marketing strategies and give the company a competitive advantage. A cost-benefit analysis of investments in improved traceability systems is difficult to perform and credible conclusions in this area are fragmented and anecdotal. However it is clear that many of the benefits related to improved traceability were not anticipated by the companies in question before the investment. Typically companies invest in traceability because they are required to either fulfil legislative or commercial requirements to enter markets and are then surprised to observe that some of the side-effects of their investment in traceability is better industrial statistics a faster turnover of ingredients raw materials and products and a reduced amount of goods in storage. Although these are positive effects many companies are not aware of them; otherwise they would have invested in better traceability. This is a major explanation for the industries lack of motivation and commitment to traceability systems.  23 Implementation gaps:  ? There is the gap between regulatory requirements and the feasibility of industry implementation (Zhang and Bhatt 2014). At the EU level this might be due to several gaps in traceability requirements (MRAG Asia Pacific 2012) such as: lack of a robust fishery control-based catch certificate; inadequate document security for split consignments; insufficient maintenance of batch integrity (here referential integrity plays an important role [McEntire et al. 2010]).  Technology gap:  ? There is a lack of verification procedures that integrate with monitoring of food authenticity (Sterling and Chiasson 2014). This lack means that we might be able to follow a product back and forth through the food chain and yet still not have certainty that the product is what it is claimed to be. For example IUU fish may enter the chain fraudulently yet once in the supply chain it is sufficiently traced along the chain. ? There is a lack of cheap functional and robust radio-frequency identification tags. The time and work involved in reading a number of bar codes is significant whereas RF-ID tags can be read instantaneously and from a distance. The cost of reading is a very important factor which to some degree prevents the introduction of smaller granularity TRUs and in particular it makes it expensive to implement referential integrity. RF-ID tags inherently provides referential integrity; no two tags ever have the same identifier and the quality of the traceability systems will be significantly improved when the bulk of the industry adopts RF-ID tags as common practice. ? There is a lack of cheap functional and robust technologies for automatic data capture. A significant cost related to the running of a traceability system is the cost associated with initial data entry that is frequently performed manually. It would simplify and accelerate the process and reduce the number of errors if technologies existed that could automatically extract the relevant data enter them into the traceability system and associate them with the TRU in question. This could be partly an implementation gap. To some degree these technologies exist but they are underused and they are in general not seamlessly connected to the traceability system.  Standards gaps:  ? The analysis of traceability standards and norms revealed a series of inconsistencies both between the standards/norms issued by the same institution and those issued by different institutions but referring to the same topic. ? There is a lack of uniform requirements or standards for information gathering and sharing that are needed for effective traceability (van Ruth 2014; Sterling and Chiasson 2014). This gap to some degree inhibits interoperability of technology systems along the supply chain increasing business risks and costs when choosing and adopting traceability and information systems. ? There is a lack of a �standardized seafood attribute naming list�. Different countries often have different �seafood attribute lists� and the use of standards in this area is not prevalent. For instance in different countries different names can be applied to the same species or the same name can be applied to different species (Cawthorn et al. 2015).  5.2. Inconsistencies 5.2.1. Intra-institutional inconsistency With respect to EU specific legislation related to traceability recent research shows intra-institutional inconsistency because different norms have different approaches to traceability depending mainly on the drivers of the norms. Thus when the main driver for implementing traceability relates to or can impact on human health as opposed to product quality or environmental sustainability EU legislation normally imposes effective traceability systems (Borit and Santos 2015). This finding is similar to the conclusion that can be inferred from the analysis performed in Andre (2013) regarding the consistency 24 of the provisions referring to data capture and management requirements for the EU GFL and EU IUU Regulation.  The same type of inconsistency can also be inferred from Andre (ibid.) in the case of FAO guidelines. While the provisions of the two documents are the same for data capture and management requirements they differ for unique identification requirements and are opposite regarding data communication requirements.  Intra-institutional consistency can also be inferred in the case of transition from ISO 8402 to ISO 9000 and 22005 with the provisions of the newer standards lacking the accuracy of the older one (Olsen and Borit 2013)  5.2.2. Inter-institutional inconsistency The traceability systems proposed by Codex Alimentarius EU GFL and ISO 8402 9000 and 22005 lack inter-institutional consistency. As explained in the specialty literature (Olsen and Borit 2013) they do not refer to traceability in the same way. In addition to the problem of all of these standards and norms using a verb phrase that is either recursive (i.e. traceability means to trace) or vague (i.e. traceability means to follow) there are problems such as: not identifying exactly what the TRUs are (Codex); not indicating which stages of production should be covered by traceability (ISO) or limiting this coverage to specific stages (Codex); not explaining how to trace (all except ISO 8402); and not mentioning what properties should be recorded by the traceability system (EU GFL) or just mentioning only one (Codex).  The same inter-institutional consistency can be seen in the three main categories of traceability standards and regulations that this study follows: international standards and guidelines regulatory standards and industry and NGO non-regulatory standards. As indicated in Andre (2013) the provisions of international standards and guidelines vary substantially with regard to unique identification requirements and data communication requirements while they are more consistent with regard to data management and capture requirements. The provisions of the EU the United States and Japan are consistent with regard to data communication requirements but are less consistent with regard to unique identification and data capture and management requirements. The provisions of the non-regulatory standards with regard to data capture and management are consistent among documents and with the respective ones from international standards and guidelines except in the RFMO documentation schemes. The provisions for unique identification requirements and for data communication requirements vary among these non-regulatory standards.   25 6. CONCLUSIONS This study was commissioned to identify and analyse gaps and inconsistencies in the current traceability standards and regulations taking into account the following traceability specifications: (i) how the integrity of product tracking is maintained; (ii) special consideration for developing countries and small scale fisheries; (iii) the notion of equivalency; and (iv) the notion of harmonization. As a first step in reaching this goal the key terms in understanding the concept of traceability were explained (e.g. granularity transformations referential integrity) and the concept was described in connection with related notions (e.g. traceability systems transparency analytical methods etc.). The second step consisted in performing a comprehensive literature review on which the gap analysis of the traceability standards and regulations was built. The last step in this study was performing a content analysis of selected international standards and guidelines regulatory standards and industry and NGO nonregulatory standards. By employing this multi-method analysis several awareness commitment implementation technology and standards gaps were identified and described. In addition specific interand intra-institutions inconsistencies were highlighted. Filling in the gaps and addressing the inconsistencies are not easy tasks. Several practical recommendations for action are made in Section 7.   26 7. RECOMMENDATIONS ? Increase awareness of what traceability is how it is different from other concepts that may appear similar to traceability and how traceability may add value to a company or a business. An important challenge is to communicate to companies that their belief that their traceability systems are good (enough) is only partly true; companies normally only think of their internal traceability when they assess their own capabilities. There are several ways of accomplishing this awareness such as: writing scientific and popular science articles about traceability; having presentations on traceability in relevant forums in particular government and industry events; and including traceability in the syllabus both for government and industry training and for relevant academic courses. In most instances the focus should be on the benefits that traceability provides rather than on the technical details involved when implementing traceability. Previous experience has shown that if motivation is present both at the managerial and operational level in a company then any technical difficulties will be overcome and (most often) successful implementation will follow. ? Traceability is now an � la carte menu where a company has to make multiple choices for instance on granularity on whether to have referential integrity on what data elements to record on how to name and transmit them on whether to use a standard and on what standard(s) to use in that case and so on. A self-assessment scheme for seafood traceability would be useful (whether the user is from a developing or developed country large or small-scale fishery a small company or international enterprise) in which the different alternatives are clearly spelled out the advantages and disadvantages of each alternative are indicated and recommendations are made in relation to which selections belonged together and so on. This would allow companies to make informed decisions before investing based on their economic constraints and their level of ambition. It would also enable benchmarking between companies so that a given company could ascertain their current situation and compare it with where they want to be. ? Standardization and harmonization is a challenge but the lack of uptake of standards is a bigger problem than the use of conflicting standards. Thus raising awareness about the utility of using already existing standards and possible extending/adapting them if needed rather than creating new systems or standards. ? A global framework for legal and traceable seafood especially in the captured fishery sector has been recommended by some important actors especially World Wildlife Fund. If the goal is to reduce IUU fishing by making it difficult for products with IUU origin to enter the legal supply chain such a global framework is a logical recommendation. However this goal is not the same as the goal of deciding on the optimal level of traceability for a company or a chain. Reducing IUU fishing is an idealistic goal and more prevention is obviously better (provided that the cost is not too high). Deciding on level of traceability is a pragmatic goal and there is room both for ambitious companies that regard transparency as part of their branding and that want as good a traceability system as possible as well as for companies that only want to satisfy minimum requirements. For this reason a global framework or even a global standard for traceability is less relevant; various levels of ambition must be supported and a certain degree of variety and of freedom of choice are needed with respect to how to perform the implementation. In this context the point is interoperability. There could be different traceability systems but they should be able to communicate relevant information without loss of key data.    27 8.

Abstract The goal of this article is to propose Game World Design and Analysis for SocioEcological Systems (GAS) a framework for the design and analysis of game worlds through socio-ecological systems lenses. Game World Design and Analysis for SocioEcological Systems invites designers to a structured reflection of their choices regarding gameworld correspondencewith a real or fictional reference system (assessed through accuracy comprehensiveness and balance) and game world consistency. The framework spells out the main elements to be included in the game world for that to be a credible socio-ecological system. The GAS framework is demonstrated on Nusfjord (2017) as an exemplar of natural resource management�themed analog game. The framework is built using an interdisciplinary approach to game studies history media and literary studies and natural resource management research. The application of the framework has the potential of making the design and analysis of game worlds more relevant to the sustainability discourse of the 21st Century. 1Norwegian College of Fishery Science UiT The Arctic University of Norway Troms� Norway Corresponding Author: Melania Borit Norwegian College of Fishery Science UiT The Arctic University of Norway Breivika Tromso 9037 Norway. Email: melania.borit@uit.no Keywords game design game world socio-ecological systems worldbuilding sustainability Introduction Against the backdrop of the global development challenges of the 21st century systems thinking is increasingly important for people�s daily lives. Games also exhibit this trend with scholars pleading for incorporating more complex systems concepts into commercial games as a way to offer �a public outlet for exploring the complex interdependencies of a changing world� (Kelly and Nardi 2014 no page). While this is a timely and sensible advice how to follow it is not straightforward either from a design point of view or a game analysis one. This study aims to offer concrete guidance on how the concept of systems and more specifically socio-ecological systems (SESs) can be included in games be they digital or analog by proposing a framework for the design and analysis of game worlds: the GAS framework�Game World Design and Analysis for SESs. The main research question of the study is to explore how SES thinking can be incorporated in the design and analysis of game worlds by building on knowledge and experience from the domains of game studies history media and literary studies and natural resource management. The tool that we propose can be used when designing or analyzing games where SESs are a major part of the theme type category or mechanism (e.g. Agricola (2007) Suburbia (2012) Lignum (2015) Stardew Valley (2016) or Fishing: North Atlantic (2020)). After describing the GAS framework and its potential users (i.e. game designers and game analysts) we demonstrate its use from an analyst perspective by examining Nusfjord (2017) as an exemplar of natural resource management�themed game. This is a successful and high profile board game with a clear economic development theme and placed in a historical context. In this game the players take the roles as the owners of a major fishing company in Nusfjord a small fishing village in the Lofoten archipelago in Norway. Nusfjord is a real place and the Lofoten fishery is a significant part of Norwegian coastal and fisheries history. Nusfjord the game is designed by Rosenberg (2017) and it is published for the commercial entertainment market. The scope of the game analysis is to demonstrate the applicability of the framework in relation to the discourse on sustainable SESs management. This study contributes to the debate on whether and how contemporary board games could become more progressive in their depiction of SESs (e.g. LaPense?e (2016)). Today�s game designers have certain responsibilities and transforming players for the better is one of them (Schell 2019). Designers have the challenge and opportunity to design for innovation to produce ground-breaking player experience by trying to solve difficult problems in game design such as addressing the relationships between games and learning or asking difficult questions about what games are what they can be and what their impact is on the players both individually and Weines and Borit 263 culturally (Fullerton 2018). Responding to these demands the GAS framework empowers designers to move players from having a simplified concept of the world they are immersing themselves in during play to reflecting on all dimensions of SESs and as such be more aware of the world they live in. The benefits of using GAS as a design tool range from streamlining world design practices to helping the designer in becoming an active agent of change through creating meaningful play. Socio-Ecological Systems Within a system the component parts and the static relationships among them are the structure of the system whereas the changes that occur in those components and the relationships among them over time are the processes characteristic of the system (Raser 1972). Thus in order to simulate any system one must be able to describe both the structure and the processes of the system. Since SESs are a set of critical resources�natural social (including cultural) and economic�whose flow and use are regulated by a combination of ecological and social systems (Redman Grove & Kuby 2004) in their case the structure includes component parts from both ecological and social systems. Fisheries forestry agriculture water harvesting or urban areas are examples of SESs. These are all instances when humans intervene in a natural environment that in turn shapes humans and their societies. A SES can be described in various ways: a coherent system of biophysical (e.g. grass and rocks) and social factors (e.g. rituals and employment) that regularly interact in a resilient sustained manner; a system that is defined at several spatial temporal and organizational scales which may be hierarchically linked; and a perpetually dynamic complex system with continuous adaptation (Redman et al. 2004). As explained in Weber (2019) SES components interact in nonlinear ways that make responses and the effects of change difficult to predict. Socio-ecological systems function in a twoway feedback loop in which a change in one subsystem can impact the other and vice versa. Socio-ecological systems are hierarchic for example governmental institutions on city level provincial level or national level are hierarchical levels within the social subsystem or the Antarctic Atlantic the Weddell Sea and the Larsen Ice Shelf depict a nested ecosystem with subsystems of different spatial scales. As Ostrom (2009) explains �SESs are composed of multiple subsystems and internal variables within these subsystems at multiple levels analogous to organisms composed of organs organs of tissues tissues of cells cells of proteins etc. In a complex SES subsystems such as a resource system (e.g. a coastal fishery) resource units (lobsters) users (fishers) and governance systems (organizations and rules that govern fishing on that coast) are relatively separable but interact to produce outcomes at the SES level which in turn feedback to affect these subsystems and their components as well other larger or smaller SESs.� In real life managing these systems without taking into consideration all their components and the relationship between them is considered a wicked problem numerous examples showing how 264 Games and Culture 17(2) challenging it is to develop fisheries forestry agricultural exploitations mining or urban areas in a sustainable way (Defries & Nagendra 2017). The SES that is included in the demonstration of the framework proposed by this study is fisheries. As explained in Syed Borit & Spruit (2018) the two main dimensions of a fishery are the human dimension (i.e. human agents communities of these and their institutions) and the natural dimension (i.e. biotic such as predator species and prey species and abiotic such as water temperature and nutrients). Worldbuilding There are three dimensions that characterize every game (Aarseth 2003): gameplay (the players� actions strategies and motives) game structure (the rules of the game including the simulation rules) and game world (fictional content topology/level design textures etc.). As such there are many types of game design (Brathwaite & Schreiber 2009): system design (the creation of rules and underlying mathematical patterns in a game) user interface (the design of how the players interact with the game and how the player receives information and feedback from the game through game components) and world design (the creation of the overall backstory setting and theme of the game; it often determines the scope of all the other design tasks related to the game). The game world exists in the imagination of the player and the game is a doorway to this world (Schell 2019). The world presented by the game cues the player into making assumptions about the rules of the game (Juul 2005). For example if an object looks like a fishing boat it is supposed to catch fish. At the same time the rules of the game cue the player into imagining the world (Juul 2005). For example if one rule is that all the fish is sold at the end of a round the player can imagine that there is a market for that fish even though this market is not explicitly described. Thus through the combination of rules mechanics and components games create an imaginary world that the players experience. The actions made by players convey a sense of a connected whole: players create a story in the world of the game through the actions they make (Arnaudo 2018). Worldbuilding is the design of this imaginary world often beginning with space and time representations but �potentially including complete cultural studies of inhabitants languages mythologies governments politics economies etc.� (Fullerton 2018) Designing game worlds bears similarities with the design of imaginary worlds for other media for example movies literature or extended reality (Zaidi 2017). As such methods to build worlds or analyze them can be borrowed and used across media. According to Wolf (2014) imaginary worlds have three properties that have to be taken into consideration during the worldbuilding process: invention completeness and consistency. Invention can be defined as the degree to which default assumptions based on the real world (or Primary World) have been changed in the game world (or Secondary World) �regarding such things as geography history language physics Weines and Borit 265 biology zoology culture custom and so on� (Wolf 2014). Designers can decide if they want to invent a lot of the world (e.g. names artifacts technologies customs landmasses animals creatures and laws of time and space) like in Gloomhaven (2017) which takes place in a fantasy setting. Designers can also stay as close as possible to the real world like in Agricola (2007) where players are farmers in 17th century Germany. The second property completeness refers to the degree to which the world contains explanations and details players could expect. Besides the quantity of details included a sense that the world has a background and history is also necessary for it to seem complete. The third property consistency is the degree to which world details are feasible and without contradiction (e.g. the world of The Manhattan Project: Energy Empire (2016)). Lacking consistency may make a game world seem sloppily constructed or even random and disconnected. Inconsistencies may appear in the storyline background details world infrastructure or world mechanics. As each of these properties grow worldbuilding becomes more challenging because increased completeness requires more complex consistency checks while consistency will limit what kind of invention is possible when the world grows. Thus all three properties should be considered simultaneously as the world takes shape. The optimal combination of invention completeness and consistency would make a game world more or less believable possibly having consequences on gameplay and the feeling of immersion (Wolf 2014) although sometimes players may become less interested in the representational level of the game and more focused on the rules of the game (Juul 2005). When building a game world based on real places people or events one also invokes history. Whether or not the game is designed as a historical game cannot be easily decoupled from the way in which it makes use of aesthetics that evoke a historical setting. Considering that games contribute to constructing players� understanding of their own past it is critical to engage in the debates surrounding the legitimacy of games as historical representations (Begy 2017). In the context of a game that invokes a historical setting an important element is that games are processes not artifacts and through gameplay they provide players with agency in how the representation of history is constructed and experienced (Kapell & Elliott 2013). Furthermore games allow players to both experience a systemic context for the actions they make as well as the consequences of these choices. The place of history in games is not only limited to illustrate actions and reactions but to foster engagement with the past. Returning to the argument made by Begy (2017) this makes questions of legitimate use of history apparent. The representations of history that players experience in games can form or shape their understanding of history. This means that game designers have the responsibility to reflect on the degree of accuracy (or the degree of invention to use Wolf�s terminology) they aim for when the game worlds they design incorporate or simulate the real world and to make their decisions explicit to avoid misunderstandings. For example Twilight Struggle (2005) which simulates the Cold War between the United 266 Games and Culture 17(2) States and the Soviet Union uses the discredited geopolitical �domino theory� as the basis for its simulation which makes an engaging game but can promote misunderstanding of the complexity of the Cold War (Harrigan & Wardrip-Fruin 2011). GAS Framework Description While there are several influential publications for guiding game design (e.g Bjork & Holopainen 2005; Duke 2014; Elverdam & Aarseth 2007; Engelstein & Shalev 2019; Ja?rvinen 2008; Juul 2005; McCall 2020; Schell 2019) none of these includes a detailed description of how to design the game world. Facing this challenge when designing our own games we decided to build the GAS framework as a solution that we first used ourselves and then decided to share with the wider community. Since worldbuilding is an exercise undertaken in a variety of other fields (e.g. movies literature or mixed reality experiences) although the terminology applied to the process may differ (Zaidi 2017) advice on worldbuilding from these related media can be adapted for game design and we have used this approach when building GAS. As noted by Rapoport �[�] frameworks are neither models nor theories. Models describe how things work whereas theories explain phenomena. Frameworks do neither; rather they help to think about phenomena to order material revealing patters �� (Rapoport 1985 page 256). As such we have chosen to call our design and analysis tool a framework. The GAS framework is visualized in Table 1. Out of space considerations the table also includes a brief demonstration of the applicability of the framework from an analyst perspective. We chose this perspective in the demonstration and not that of a game designer because we considered that guiding the reader through reflecting over a well-known game is more effective in understanding the framework than exposing the reader to the intricacies of designing one of our own games. The core principles of the framework are (1) games are vehicles that transport their players between different realities (Peters & Westelaken 2014); (2) games tell stories through the combination of content and mechanics that create a consistent world where players have agency (Arnaudo 2018); (3) like other forms of media games are lenses through which their users experience and gain awareness of different topics (Schell 2019). The framework is divided in three parts: decisions that are taken in the beginning of the world design phase (Part A) reflection over general elements of a SES (Part B) and considerations that have to be made in the end of the world design phase (Part C) although these considerations can be kept in mind throughout the design process. The elements listed under Part A of the GAS framework invite to structured reflection over the correspondence between what is intended to be represented Weines and Borit 267 T ab le 1.

We call this previously described system a reference system. Building on Wolf�s concepts of invention and completeness presented in the sectionWorldbuilding and on (Smythe & Thompson 2015) practical approach to capturing internal cognitive representations of a real world the GAS framework includes three reflection points: (1) The degree of accuracy understood as the extent the game world correctly depicts the reference system. (2) The degree of comprehensiveness understood as the extent to which the game world encompasses all of the components of the reference system. (3) The degree of balance understood as the extent to which the game world is focused equally across the reference system�s areas of focus. The elements listed under Part B of the GAS framework build on a fusion of two of the most relevant SES frameworks used in natural resource management (Charles 2000; Ostrom 2007 2009). Ostrom�s multitier framework for analyzing a SES provided our GAS framework the conceptual tiers and linkages among the elements that constitute a SES. Because SESs are decomposable systems each of the highest-tier conceptual elements can be unpacked and related to other unpacked elements. Thus Part B of the GAS framework is organized in levels. Charles� depiction of the fishery system provided some additional elements related to the natural human and management systems that interact in an SES where humans rely on the harvesting processing and distribution of goods. The framework can be used with any (game)world that is intended to be a representation of a SES (e.g. fisheries forestry aquaculture farming mining or city development). Part C of the GAS framework brings attention to the extent in which game elements have a systematic or logical connection fit together well and do not contradict each other that is degree of consistency of the world or consistency among game elements. Although the GAS framework includes this reflection point as a final check the degree of consistency should be kept in mind throughout the design phase especially when building complex worlds where various elements build on each other. The framework accommodates both qualitative and quantitative minds as the reflection over the degree of each specific measure (e.g. balance and accuracy) can be made by writing a short description and/or by using a partly anchored 5-point numerical rating scale which is generally considered to provide the respondent sufficient enough graded choices (Burke Johnson & Christensen 2014). When used by designers reflection on this degree happens in the beginning of the process (i.e. one decides how historically correct the game should be and then designs game elements) while when used by analysts this reflection is made in the form of an evaluation performed after analyzing the game. Weines and Borit 275 Users As mentioned above we envisage two types of users of the GAS framework: world designers and researchers/analysts. Thus the framework can be used in a designer mode or an analyst mode. These users can be cross-media world designers and researchers/analysts (e.g. board games video games comics film literature extended reality etc.) although the wording of the framework focuses on game designers/analysts. Practitioners with a specific interest in generating worlds or in creating meaningful play by helping the players make sense of the complex interdependencies of a changing world can use the GAS framework as a complementary tool to any other tools that are out there on game design for example (Raphael Bachen Lynn Baldwin-Philippi & McKee 2010; Schell 2019) or on worldbuilding for example (Wrede 2009; Zaidi 2017). An important aspect of using the GAS framework regardless the mode is that while other similar frameworks or worldbuilding processes focus mainly on separate elements of a world (Zaidi 2017) GAS provides a method to depict the interconnections of these elements within a system. By being straightforward and providing a worked example the framework can be easily embedded in everyday practices of designers and analysts. Worlds designers be they worldbuilding practitioners across media graphic designers or designers of bits for games (e.g. character meeples and shaped resources) can use the framework as a checklist or a fill in matrix. However the elements of the GAS framework are not exhaustive and items can be added as needed. The framework does not list items in order of importance because their importance varies in different contexts. However it must be made clear that these items are not isolated silos and the SES is not the sum of the elements but emerges from their integration within a game and through the meaning created by the player from the game manual title box rules and other elements before during or after playing the game. As also explained by Wrede (2009) while many of these elements may be helpful or crucial to certain game worlds they will not all apply to every world. It is not necessary for a designer to include all or even any of the elements in order to start or finish designing. The idea is simply to provoke designers into thinking about the ways their settings and backgrounds hang together or not from a SES perspective. The GAS framework should not be considered an exhaustive and final list but as a starting point from which each individual designer can compile a personal list. The number of elements may lead to confusion about what is essential to the game world and what is not and render the process of building a coherent world challenging especially if designers are picking and choosing elements from different categories. If coherence is relevant for the game then we advise game designers to have this property in mind when reflecting over the framework elements. Moreover as Flanagan (2009 p. 261) 276 Games and Culture 17(2) noted �most players are not attracted to overly didactic communication� thus designers have to reflect over what is the right balance of elements for their game world in order to create a safe place where players feel comfortable to play even in a critical way. As in the case of designers the GAS framework can be used as a complementary tool to any other tools that are out there on game analysis for example (Gonza?lez & Adelantado 2016; Lindley 2003). By operationalizing elements of a SES it is possible for researchers/analysts to assess the SES representation in the game and reflect over what critical theories can be used for analyzing some elements of the game or the game as SES (e.g. eco-criticism or indigenous criticism). Demonstration Proposing guidelines seems easier than applying them. Thus in order to show the applicability of the GAS framework and to encourage the reader to use it we provide a demonstration of the tool from an analyst perspective in Table 1. In order to help the reader follow the comments included in the demonstration we provide here a general description of this game. For the purpose of this study the Nusfjord coastal area in Norway is considered our focal SES. In Part B of the demonstration the game elements in Nusfjord the game are mapped to the SES elements of the framework. Nusfjord (2017) is a competitive strategy Eurogame in the Worker Placement style. The theme is economic development with the players acting as the owners of a major fishing company in Nusfjord in the Lofoten archipelago in Norway during its �heyday.� Development is performed by exploiting natural resources and using basic market mechanisms in addition to considering the advice from the local community (i.e. �the village elders�). To our knowledge Nusfjord is one of the very few board games with commercial fisheries as its main topic. Following the format from Borit Borit & Olsen (2018) an overview of the game is presented in Table 2. Here we use the terminology from Engelstein and Shalev�s Building Blocks of Tabletop Game Design (2019) to reference the game mechanics. Nusfjord is a competitive game (STR-01). The goal of the players is to develop and expand their harbor and the surrounding area. Each player has their own harbor area board with dedicated space for buildings forest tiles and ships. The game comes with the different decks of buildings that emphasize different elements of the game: �herring� �codfish� and �mackerel.� There is a small element of Hidden Information (UNC-08) as each player gets a private hand of buildings in the midstages which they can build before these enter the common pool. The worker mechanic reinforces the economic development theme as the actions in general Weines and Borit 277 Table 2. Summary of the main aspects of the game Nusfjord (2017).

Conclusions Based on SES theory and worldbuilding design principles our study expands the pool of tools available to the critical game designer by introducing the GAS framework a tool for design and analysis of game worlds through SESs lenses. The framework shows how focus on the components of SESs can inform decisions taken when designers engage in worldbuilding for games or researchers analyze game worlds. Through focusing on the accuracy comprehensiveness and balance of the elements in a game world it is possible to gauge the correspondence of the game world with a given SES. Not all games aim for historical accuracy or lifelike settings but by analyzing these elements designers or analysts can structure their critical reflection on the values and mental models that are embedded in games and how they shape the narratives players create when playing them. We present a brief demonstration of the framework in the analyst mode by examining the SES of Nusfjord (2017) that is mapping the game elements of Nusfjord into the general components of a SES. The demonstration shows how the game has moderate comprehensiveness and consistency in addition to low balance and accuracy. The game designer has stated that the development of the game began as a stock market game (Weber 2017) which is visible in the game�s catch distribution mechanic. However in Nusfjord harvest of resources has no lasting consequences and the function of the environment is to provide resources for the expansion of the players� companies. The underlying paradigm that focuses on development and growth without posing any questions about scarcity and sustainability is unfortunately common in games (Kelly & Nardi 2014). The actions of players will not affect the sustainability of the fish stocks and while it is possible to deforest the game world players can reforest the island instantly. The GAS framework is intended as a tool that can be combined with other approaches and frameworks contributing insight on how fields pertaining to governance and natural resource management can be combined with game studies. In light of the current focus on human impact on the natural environment reflection on how human beings understand their relationship with the resource systems human society depends on is too important for games not to treat seriously. In future research the GAS approach can also be operationalized more specifically on other topics dealing with sustainability. The GAS framework is a potentially powerful tool for designers (and game analysts alike) to guide the players through the complexity inherent in SESs as playing (simulation) games is considered a way to understand complex systems of relationships and to acquire a holistic sense of how everything is connected (Schell 2019). We believe that this move can be achieved through restructuring the design of game worlds around structured reflection about the system to be depicted by the game. Weines and Borit 279 �Through participation in a game the players experience environments and situations where they have meaningful interactions with the elements that are present in the game creating a space for questioning the content of the game� (Flanagan 2009). Such questioning coined as �critical play� is characterized by a careful examination of social cultural political or even personal themes that function as alternates to popular play spaces. Since the meaning players will extract from their play emerges from the choices made by the designers it is important to be conscious about what implicit mental models are embedded in the game by these choices. As such the GAS framework can support designers in their iterations of creating meaningful play by adding reflection points on how the complexity of SESs is considered in the values embedded in their design.

This paper gives an overview of relevant traceability definitions outlining similarities differences and the consequences of choosing one definition over another. To ascertain which definitions are most commonly used 101 scientific articles relating to food traceability were reviewed. All the definitions commonly referred to in these articles are shown to have weaknesses. By combining the best parts of the existing definitions this paper offers a new possible definition of traceability as pertaining to food products.Introduction Background In recent years there has been an increased focus on product traceability in food supply chains. Around the turn of the century the main driver for improved food product traceability was the many tragic and costly food scandals that received wide media attention around the world at that time. These included the Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE or mad cow disease) case in the early and midnineties (Wales Harvey & Warde 2006) the massive Hudson Foods recall in the US in 1997 (USDA 1997) and the dioxin contamination of chicken feed in Belgium in 1999 (Bernard et al. 2002) to mention but a few. These scandals resulted in massive press coverage and increased demandsfrom business partners and consumers relating to documentation and traceability of food products. As a result traceability requirements appeared or were strengthened in national legislation and in commercial standards for food production. In recent years electronic systems and standards for food product traceability have improved a lot. This has led to a potential for benefits associated with investing in better traceability systems beyond reducing risk and meeting requirements. These potential benefits typically include:  Reduced cost and labour related to better information logistics and less re-punching of data internally.  Reduced cost and labour related to exchange of information between business partners through better integration of electronic systems.  Access to more accurate and more timely information needed to make better decisions in relation to how and what to produce.  Competitive advantage through the ability to document desirable product characteristics in particular relating to sustainability ethics and low environmental impact. This means that traceability has become an important tool in a variety of areas and sectors and traceability is being referred to in many disciplines and scientific articles. Unfortunately as this article shows the definitions used and the respective interpretations of what traceability is are neither precise nor consistent. This article discusses the various ways traceability is defined what the definitions mean and entail and also offers a recommendation for how traceability as pertaining to food products should be understood and defined. For the rest of this article �traceability� should be understood to have the suffix �as pertaining to food products�. There are many other meanings and applications of the term including �measurement traceability� and �transaction traceability� but this article does not attempt to analyze or expand the term �traceability� in contexts other than the one just specified.Structure of this paper As we cannot assume that the reader is familiar with all the various definitions of traceability that exist we begin by listing each of them in Section 1.3. The methodology for the systematic review of scientific papers published in the 143P. Olsen M. Borit / Trends in Food Science & Technology 29 (2013) 142e150area of food product traceability is described in Section 2. Section 3 outlines the outcome of the literature study and based on this five existing definitions are chosen for further study. This section also includes a brief overview of definitions of - and references to traceability systems in scientific articles and the properties these systems have. In Section 4 the definitions of the term �traceability� are analyzed in more detail and compared with the properties and functionality commonly assigned to traceability systems as outlined in Section 3. Finally by combining parts of various existing definitions a new definition is suggested; a definition hopefully without the weaknesses present in the existing alternatives. Existing definitions of traceability When we started our investigation we did not know exactly which definitions we would find in frequent use but to increase consistency and readability we have chosen to include all the pre-existing definitions referred to in this article in this section. This includes traceability as defined in international standards in legislation in some dictionaries and also the most cited standalone definition formulated in a scientific article according to our literature review. Traceability as defined in international standards Traceability defined in ISO 8402. An old practical and often used definition of traceability is found in the International Standardization Organization (ISO) 8402 (ISO 1994) where traceability is defined as: �The ability to trace the history application or location of an entity by means of recorded identifications.� This definition clearly states what should be traced (history application and location) and also how the tracing should be done (by means of recorded identifications). It suffers however from recursion and thus incompleteness related to the fact that �traceability� is defined by using the term �trace� and the term �trace� is not defined here. It has this recursion in common with many other definitions as indicated below. In this paper and in particular related to the definitions we analyze we understand �trace� to mean �find� �follow� or �identify�. An additional problem is that ISO 8402 was withdrawn by ISO and superseded by ISO 9000 which uses a different definition of traceability. Traceability defined in ISO 9000 and ISO 22005. ISO 9000 (ISO 2000) has a slightly less specific definition of traceability: �The ability to trace the history application or location of that which is under consideration�. Note that in this newer definition the fragment �by means of recorded identifications� has been removed and this has consequences as discussed in Section 4. The ISO 22005 (ISO 2005) definition is word for word the same as the ISO 9000 definition but ISO 9000 is a standard for quality management systems in general whereasISO 22005 is a specific standard for traceability in the food and feed chain. ISO 22005 adds that �Terms such as document traceability computer traceability or commercial traceability should be avoided.� For all these ISO definitions (ISO 8402 ISO 9000 ISO 22005) there is an additional clause which states that when relating to products traceability specifically entails �the origin of materials and parts the processing history and the distribution and location of the product after delivery.� Traceability defined in Codex Alimentarius. The Codex Alimentarius Commission Procedural Manual (FAO/WHO 1997) defines traceability as �the ability to follow the movement of a food through specified stage(s) of production processing and distribution�. This definition reduces traceability to the following of the movement only and if taken literally this definition is very different from all the others outlined here which use at least potentially more comprehensive verb phrases. Codex Alimentarius is recognized by the World Trade Organization as an international reference point for the resolution of disputes concerning food safety and consumer protection so the traceability definition there is of special importance even though it is (as shown in Section 3) not commonly referred to at least not in scientific articles. Traceability as defined in legislation: the EU GFL (Regulation 178/2002) The EU General Food Law (EU 2002) defines traceability as �The ability to trace and follow a food feed foodproducing animal or substance intended to be or expected to be incorporated into a food or feed through all stages of production processing and distribution�. This definition is often referred to in scientific articles and it is quite detailed with respect to what should be traced and followed and where. It is however less detailed when it comes to describing what type of properties are relevant or how the traceability might be implemented. Also substituting the �trace� phrase used in other definitions with �trace and follow� does not solve the recursion problem. Standalone definitions of traceability in scientific articles: traceability defined in Moe (1998) The most commonly referred to definition of traceability that comes from a scientific paper is in Moe (1998). It says �Traceability is the ability to track a product batch and its history through the whole or part of a production chain from harvest through transport storage processing distribution and sales�. Moe specifies that this is �chain traceability� and defines �internal traceability� as the same thing but �internally in one of the steps in the chain�; a useful distinction notmade inmost other definitions. �Track� is used as theverb herewhich avoids recursion but does not really add clarity as the term is not clearly defined. �Product batch� is that which is being traced here which introduces the question related to what a product batch is and whether all food product 144 P. Olsen M. Borit / Trends in Food Science & Technology 29 (2013) 142e150traceability is necessarily done on product batch level. For further discussion on this see Section 4. Traceability as defined in dictionaries While dictionary definitions of traceability in general are too imprecise for our purposes and not frequently referred to in scientific articles we decided to perform a brief examination of these definitions anyway to get an indication of what the general meaning of the term �traceability� is. Most dictionaries offer only generic definitions of traceability and typically �traceability� is only defined as �the ability to trace�. This is the case of Dictionary.com (Dictionary.com 2012) The Free Dictionary by Farlex (Farlex 2012) Merriam-Webster (Merriam-Webster 2012) and the Oxford Dictionaries Online (Oxford University Press 2012). The verb �trace� in turn has a plethora of meanings and the most relevant for our purposes are �to follow the footprints track or trail of� and �to follow or study out in detail or step by step� (Merriam-Webster 2012). �Trace� is reported as being a word where the first known use is in the 14th century and the origin is from the Anglo-French tracer (Merriam-Webster 2012) the Vulgar Latin tractiare e to drag and the Latin tractus e past participle of trahere e to pull (Farlex 2012). Only a fewdictionaries offer relevant definitions of �traceability� beyond �ability to trace�. Cambridge Dictionaries Online (Cambridge University Press 2012) defines the term as �the ability to discover information about where and how a product was made� which while being fairly generic is still a suitable definition for our purposes and itmanages to avoid the recursion present in many other definitions. The most extensive dictionary definition of �traceability� is found in Webster�s Online Dictionary (WOD) (Webster�s Online Dictionary 2012) where domain definitions speciality expressions and extended definitions are given. Under the domain �Environment� WOD mentions �The ability to trace the history application or location of an item data or sample using recorded documentation� which is very close to the ISO 8402 definition recursion included. Under �Extended definitions� WOD adds: 1) �Traceability refers to the completeness of the information about every step in a process chain.� 2) �Traceability is ability to chronologically interrelate the uniquely identifiable entities in a way that matters.�Table 1.

Extended definition 2) pre-supposes uniquely identifiable entities which in the context of food products is beyond definition and into implementation of traceability. Extended definition 3) is in contrast with common usage of the term �verify� as pertaining to attributes of food products; see discussion on this in Section 4. Methodology Literature search strategy The key objective of this paper is to examine the use of the term �traceability� in scientific articles relating to food products and food production and to point out relevant definitions including their properties and mutual inconsistencies. To establish which definitions are used in scientific papers a systematic literature review was needed. To accomplish this a search strategy was developed as outlined in Table 1. Given the search criteria in the table ISI Web of Knowledge provided in total 243 hits and all were included in the preliminary documents list. Google Scholar and Science Direct delivered too many results; therefore 100 articles were picked out randomly from the top hits of each list. After eliminating documents that did not meet the inclusion criteria listed in Table 2 101 articles remained for analysis. These remaining articles were then investigated using the coding scheme outlined in Table 3 and the data was recorded in a database. The final coding question was expanded as the literature study proceeded. Initially ISO 22005 was not a separate option but as several papers referred to it it was given a separate code in the investigation. Results Overall results of the literature search Most of the analyzed articles (65% n � 101) mentioned a traceability definition which means that one third of scientific articles in this field took the definition of traceability for granted at least in that they did not provide a definition for the term. Out of those referring to a definition 66% used a single definition while the rest referred to at leastific articles to be included in the review of traceability definitions.

Olsen M. Borit / Trends in Food Science & Technology 29 (2013) 142e150two definitions. The fact that more than 20% of all scientific articles in this field referred to at least two definitions might indicate that the definition of traceability should not be taken for granted. The most common definition used in all the assessed documents was EU GFL (24%) followed by ISO 8402 (17%) and ISO 9000/ISO 22005 (8%/5%). It is worth noting that the ISO 8402 definition continued to be used even after the standard was withdrawn in 2000 as indicated in Fig. 1. 14% of the articles provided their own definition of traceability and 14% of the articles referred to definitions found in other scientific articles. Among these the one devised by Tina Moe in 1998 was the most referred to (5%); no other definitions from scientific articles were referenced in more than two papers. Despite being an international reference point for the resolution of disputes concerning food safety and consumer protection the Codex Alimentarius definition of traceability was referred to in only 5% of the articles. For a discussion on the Codex definition of traceability and its limitations see Section 4. An additional observation from the literature study is that in several scientific papers the term �traceability� was used in a way which does not correspond to any of the definitions listed above. Phrases like �labels with different degrees of traceability information� and �to find out about the traceability of a product� were not uncommon. From the context it was clear that many of these articles used the word �traceability� when they meant �product properties� in particular properties relating to origin. WeTable 3. Coding questions and guide used to analyze the scientific articles included in the systematic review of traceability definitions. 1. Does the article include or refer to a definition of traceability? Yes/no. 2. If yes is it one single definition or several? Single definition/multiple definitions. 3. If yes which definition(s) does it include or refer to? ISO 8402/ISO 9000/ISO 22005/Codex Alimentarius/EU General Food Law/other author�s definition/own definition/other.have chosen not to provide a reference to these articles here partly because there were many of them and singling out a few would be unfair but also because the concept of traceability is not trivial and the definitions are contradictory so some confusion is understandable. However a shared feature of all the definitions above is the fact that traceability is not a type of information; it is the means by which information is retrieved and hence also stored and arranged. Conceptually a traceability system is quite similar to a filing cabinet in that they both deal with systematic storing and retrieving of data. Importantly neither a traceability system nor a filing cabinet care about what types of data are being stored. There is no special relationship between traceability and origin; information relating to the origin of a food product should be recorded along with any and all other types of information. In some articles the terms �traceability information� or �traceability data� were used to refer to the product properties recorded in a traceability system and this also has the potential to cause confusion. The reason is that practical implementation of traceability necessitates the introduction of codes or numbers whose sole purpose it is to provide identification and enable traceability and these codes are often referred to internally as �traceability codes� or �traceability numbers� and collectively as �traceability data� and this is then of course a different meaning of the same term. Properties of a traceability system The scientific articles included in the systematic literature review described above contained several detailed descriptions of traceability systems in various food sectors. Many of the articles went into great detail outlining what properties these traceability systems could or should have and in this area there did not seem to be significant disagreement. Opara (2003) indicates that �With respect to a food product traceability represents the ability to identify the farm where it was grown and sources of input materials as well as the ability to conduct full backward and forward tracking to determine the specific location and life history in the supply chain by means of records�. For this to happen in a supply chain a traceability system must have the following properties: 1. Ingredients and raw materials must somehow be grouped into units with similar properties what Moe (1998) and Kim Fox and Gr�uninger (1999) refer to as �traceable resource units�. 2. Identifiers/keys must be assigned to these units. Ideally these identifiers should be globally unique and never reused but in practice traceability in the food industry depends on identifiers that are only unique within a given context (typically they are unique for a given day�s production of a given product type for a given company). Expanding on this issue is beyond the scope of this paper; see Karlsen Donnelly and Olsen (2011) for a more detailed discussion on this. 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 3 5 1 6 4 2 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 2 2 1 2 2 2 2 3 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 3 2 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 3 2 1 2 2 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 3 2 5 6 9 6 0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100% 1998 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 no definition own definition definition of other authors other definition Moe 1998 ISO 8402 ISO 9000 ISO 22005 EU General Food Law Codex Alimentarius 2012 Fig. 1.

A total of 101 articles were analyzed. 146 P. Olsen M. Borit / Trends in Food Science & Technology 29 (2013) 142e1503. Product and process properties must be recorded and either directly or indirectly (for instance through a time stamp) linked to these identifiers. 4. A mechanism must exist to get access to these properties. All these requirements are necessary for food product traceability. If there is no grouping of ingredients and raw materials; if no distinction is made between what one uses or produces today and what one used or produced many years ago there is no traceability. If no identifiers are assigned to the traceable resource units one can only access immediate properties physically attached to the units (for instance on the label) and all properties that one wants to have access to would have to be copied every time a process converts an input to an output. This could work for very short and simple supply chains but in general traceability depends on assigning identifiers to units and recording properties that are linked to these identifiers. This overview of traceability system properties provides us with a benchmark for the traceability definitions. There is general consensus on what a traceability system is and what properties it could and should have. As basis for our discussion we compare the traceability definitions with the properties of a traceability system. A traceability definition can be classified as too narrow if it does not include orallow for functionality that must be provided by a traceability system. A traceability definition can be classified as too broad if it allows for systems that do not satisfy the minimum requirements for a traceability system. Discussion As basis for our discussion it is useful to make a structured comparison of the different definitions see Table 4. As an aid to evaluating the differences between these definitions we describe two hypothetical systems which offer at least some degree of food product traceability. Hypothetical system 1 (HS1) e A perfect online location tracking system for food products and all their ingredients. This could in theory be implemented by a multitude of GPS transponders (Zhang Liu Mu Moga & Zhang 2009) which would identify location of all products and ingredients at any given time so the ability to follow the food product geographically would be perfect. HS1 would include the functionality for continuous monitoring and permanent recording of the position data so that even after the fact one could see exactly where a product and all its ingredients came from and went. Hypothetical system 2 (HS2) e A rapid instrument for accurate analysis of all analytically verifiable properties a food sample may have. This could be implemented if one managed to combine into one instrument all the Table 4. Selected traceability definitions broken down in constitutive elements.

Olsen M. Borit / Trends in Food Science & Technology 29 (2013) 142e150methods and instruments currently in use to measure analytical properties of food products such as DNA fingerprinting (Ogden 2008) Magnetic Resonance (Renoua et al. 2004) and Isotope analysis (Renoua et al. 2004). The question now becomes: if one has either one or both of these instruments does one then have traceability? Very few would argue that HS1 could be a good enough food traceability system in itself. The only properties HS1 could give us access to would be exact location at a given time and according to most definitions that is only one aspect of traceability. It is worth noting that if we used the Codex Alimentarius definition of traceability HS1 would offer traceability as defined there which serves as an illustration of how narrow that particular definition is. HS2 especially if combined with HS1 would give a much broader picture. If we look at the �Product properties� column in Table 4 HS1 would give location and HS2 would give quite a lot of information about origin application and life history. Still regardless of how good HS2 was it would be limited to giving information about the analytically verifiable properties of the food sample. For many applications of traceability it is relevant also to have access to food product properties that cannot be analytically verified. These include properties such as identity of food business operator or owner at various stages in the chain processing conditions that did not directly influence the food properties data on yield and economics properties relating to ethics sustainability and legality and so on. HS1 � HS2 would only partly satisfy the ISO definitions; there are aspects of �history application or location� relating to a food product that you cannot get through tracking movement and instantaneous measurements. Moe (1998) also refers to �ability to track ... history� so again HS1 � HS2 would not be sufficient. The EU GFL definition does not indicate which properties the traceabilitysystem should provide access to but the same regulation that contains the traceability definition also contains the legal requirements for traceability of food products in the EU in general. In the EU GFL �Article 18 e Traceability� these requirements include �... identify any person from whom they have been supplied with a food ...� and ... identify the other businesses to which their products have been supplied.� Identification of persons and businesses cannot be done analytically (at least not in this context) so it is clear that a system consisting of HS1 � HS2 would not satisfy any of the definitions analyzed here (with the exception of Codex Alimentarius). Note that HS2 is an instrument for instantaneous measurement; one gets to know the properties of a food sample by measuring it there and then. This is as opposed to a system of record keeping throughout the chain (the �recorded identifications� mentioned in the ISO 8402 definition) where one assumes that if A has some property and A goes into B then B will also have this property and one knows this without needing to measure B. Note also that the analytical methods when utilized provide data that it is very relevant to record and attach to the food product for future reference. This means that record keeping is not something one does instead of using analytical methods; it is something one does to keep track of all data including the data that comes from using an analytical method or instrument. Looking at the many examples of traceability systems described in the analyzed scientific articles it seems clear that even the combination of HS1 and HS2 would not be sufficient for a perfect or even adequate food product traceability system and that access to the properties that HS1 � HS2 could not provide us with is essential in modern food production. With this as a basis we can conclude that a traceability system for food products should have the following properties: 148 P. Olsen M. Borit / Trends in Food Science & Technology 29 (2013) 142e150 It should be able to provide access to all properties of a food product not only those that can be verified analytically.  It should be able to provide access to the properties of a food product or ingredient in all its forms in all the links in the supply chain not only on product batch level.  It should facilitate traceability both backwards (where did the food product come from?) and forwards (where did it go?).  The traceability must be based on systematic recordings and exchange of these; there are many relevant properties that will be lost if there is no record-keeping system and a way of distributing/sharing the information.  In practice this means that a unit identification system or numbering scheme must be present; without it one cannot achieve many of the goals listed above. It is worth noting that when traceability is based on systematic recordings and record-keeping there is no guarantee that the recordings are true. Both error and fraud may lead to untrue claims with respect to properties of the food product. There is a clear need to verify these claims and in this area analytical methods and instruments play a crucial role. See Borit and Olsen (2012) for a discussion of this issue. Given these properties of a traceability system we can go back to the traceability definitions and evaluate them against the list outlined above. This evaluation is included in Table 5. Some comments on this evaluation:  Ideally the verb phrase should not be recursive and if it uses a different verb than �trace� it should explain it or refer to an explanation of it.  It may be relevant to keep track of any or all properties a food product may have. Therefore the definition should not limit this.  It may be relevant to keep track of the properties of any unit size so �of that which is under consideration� is good whereas focussing only on products or product batches is an unnecessary limitation.  It may be relevant to keep track of the properties of these units anywhere in the supply chain.  There is no traceability without recorded identifications and a record-keeping system and a good definitionTable 5.

In the choice between the definitions above ISO 8402 is the only one which has incorporated this final and essential property so of these it is the recommended definition to use. Nevertheless as already mentioned ISO 8402 suffers from the recursive verb phrase and also from the fact that the standard has been superseded so an ideal definition does not currently exist. Such an ideal definition should combine the best parts of the definitions above and could be phrased as follows:Traceability (n) The ability to access any or all information relating to that which is under consideration throughout its entire life cycle by means of recorded identifications. This definition has the following advantages:  It does not suffer from the weaknesses outlined above associated with the other definitions.  It closely matches the properties of traceability systems as used in the production industry in general and in the food production industry in particular.  It states that one needs to make recorded identifications if one wants to call what one is doing traceability and also that one needs to provide access to these recordings. This is in line with the properties that traceability systems used in the production industry have.  It can serve as demarcation between different scientific disciplines. There is a significant difference between having traceability (�ability to access any or all information�) and verifying the claims in a traceability system. Both are very useful tasks and interesting scientific disciplines but they are quite different. The literature search revealed that many articles did not make this distinction and it was easy to get the impression that if one wanted traceability one needed analytical tools and methods. Our view is that if one wants traceability one has to systematically record properties of �that which is under consideration� and some of these properties can be verified by analytical tools and methods (and indeed some of these properties are obtained through using analytical tools and methods).

Olsen M. Borit / Trends in Food Science & Technology 29 (2013) 142e150is that it is the recording of information and the giving access to the recorded information that constitutes traceability and this definition spells this out in detail. Note that this definition is similar to the old ISO 8402 definition and like ISO 8402 it can potentially apply to traceability of any products not only food related. While recording of information in itself is not too difficult getting access to the information later onmight be challenging in practice. This is especially true for products with many ingredients for large production runs with many inputs for deeply processed products with extensive supply chains and for products where it is difficult to link inputs that go into a production process to the respective outputs. In all these cases tracing back fromafinished product to all its ingredients and rawmaterials and all the associated recordings will result in an overwhelming amount of information which will be difficult to communicate or analyze (Olsen and Aschan 2010). Therefore computerized traceability systems are needed to keep track of this information aswell as tools for datamining analysis and visualization. Process re-engineering can help significantly with this problem especially if it involves introducing smaller production batches with fewer and more clearly defined inputs. However this practical problem does not change the fact that if one wants access to all properties a product and its respective ingredients and raw materials have then extensive record keeping is needed. Conclusion Traceability is not a trivial term and the systematic literature review shows that even in scientific papers there is a lot of confusion and inconsistency. With basis in the properties of a traceability system for food products as described in numerous articles we have concluded that record keeping is an essential aspect of traceability and that attempts to implement or define traceability without record keeping will lack significant components. Of the definitions analyzed here the only one to specify that record keeping is an essential part of traceability is ISO 8402 so with respect to phrasing it is the most accurate definition. Unfortunately the ISO 8402 standard has been withdrawn and the definition suffers from the fact that it defines traceability as �the ability to trace� without defining the term �to trace�. This means that currently scientific papers do not have an existing standard or definition without obvious weaknesses to refer to. By combining parts of existing definitions we have suggested our own definition which hopefully will be seen as an improvement over the alternatives that currently exist.

The key concepts relating to traceability and the components of a food traceability system are outlined in this report as well as an indication of how traceability relates to other methodologies and approaches for ensuring food product authenticity. The core principles of blockchain technology are outlined including different types of blockchain implementations their characteristics and some examples of solution providers and existing applications in the food industry. The last part of the report compares the functionality of traditional vs. blockchain-based food traceability systems evaluates costs and benefits and provides some practical advice on implementation issues exemplified in the red meat supply chain and the herbs and spices supply chain.  The overall conclusion is that unless speed of operation or confidentiality are considered to be the most important characteristics of the traceability system a blockchain-based implementation may be very suitable. The main benefit related to a blockchain-based food traceability system is that at least for now the blockchain-based systems are more homogenous than traditional electronic traceability systems so interoperability between different blockchain-based systems is likely to be easier to implement than interoperability between different traditional electronic traceability systems. Lack of interoperability is one of � or probably the biggest current obstacle preventing system-wide farm-tofork food product traceability so this advantage associated with blockchain-based implementations is significant. Summary/recommendation in Norwegian: Rapporten gir en oversikt over konsepter og systemer relatert til sporbarhet i n�ringsmiddelindustrien og gir ogs� en grunnleggende innf�ring i blockchainteknologi. Tradisjonelle elektroniske sporbarhetssystemer basert p� relasjonsdatabaser sammenlignes med blockchainbaserte sporbarhetssystemer og fordeler og ulemper med de respektive l�sningene evalueres.  Hovedkonklusjonen er at dersom hurtighet eller konfidensialitet er de viktigste systemegenskapene s� er tradisjonelle sporbarhetssystemer sannsynligvis bedre. Hovednytten av blockchainsystemer er at de er likere i oppbygging og struktur og at det derfor er lettere � dele og integrere data mellom bedrifter og mellom verdikjeder. Dette er en veldig viktig utfordring i n�ringsmiddelindustrien da manglende integrasjon er en av de viktigste utfordringene som hindrer tilgang til data som registreres p� ulike steder i kjeden og nytteverdien av blockchainbaserte sporbarhetssystemer er signifikant dersom de kan bidra til � l�se dette problemet.

Blockchain technology will definitely have relevant applications also in the food industry but there is no doubt that the blockchain suppliers are currently overselling their products and they are promising more than they can deliver. This report aims to disentangle hype from truth when it comes to the capability of blockchain technology to achieve traceability in food supply chains. It builds on the request by the EIT Food Knowledge and Innovation Community (KIC) to analyse two broad themes: 1. How does blockchain compare and contrast with alternative technologies and methodologies to achieve a similar outcome and what are the key selection criteria for deciding which technology to adopt? 2. What are the cost benefits and practical considerations of blockchain as applied to the food industry? Section 2 explains the methodology followed by this study and Section 3 defines the core concepts used here. Section 4 gives an overview of providers of blockchain technology and briefly describes various applications of the blockchain technology in the food sector. Section 5 compares the functionality of traditional vs. blockchain-based traceability systems and examples of costs benefits and practical considerations in various supply chains and for authorities are presented in Section 6. Conclusions and recommendations are made in Section 7.  2  2 Methodology This study employed a methodology that involved the conceptualization of key terms (Section 3) and a literature review of the application of blockchain technology in the food sector (Section 4). The conceptualisation of terms related to food traceability and electronic traceability systems was based on relevant scientific publications and reports in this area in particular general publications that focused on defining terms and concepts. The conceptualisation of terms related to blockchain and blockchain technology was partly based on relevant scientific publications and reports in this area and partly on online articles white papers and expert user opinions. This study is limited to application of blockchain technology in the (food) production industry and as such it does not analyse other possible applications of blockchain technology of which there are many. The conceptualisation and the subsequent literature review forms the basis for the comparison of the functionality of traditional vs. blockchain-based traceability systems (Section 5) and the analysis of costs benefits and practical considerations relating to the use of blockchain technology in two food sectors (red meat sector and herbs and spices) and for authorities (Section 6).    3  3 Conceptual framework 3.1 Traceability and traceability systems The following constitutes a short and by no means exhaustive primer on traceability terms and concepts. The terms and concepts outlined are the ones needed for comparing a traceability system based on blockchain technology with a traditional electronic traceability system. 3.1.1 Traceability concept terms and definitions There are numerous definitions of traceability most of them recursive in that they define traceability as �the ability to trace� without defining exactly what �trace� means in this context. An attempt to merge the best parts of various existing definitions while avoiding recursion and ambiguity was made by two of the authors of this report (Olsen & Borit 2013): Traceability The ability to access any or all information relating to that which is under consideration throughout its entire life cycle by means of recorded identifications.  This emphasises that any information can be traced that traceability applies to any sort of object or item in any part of the life cycle and that recorded identifications need to be involved. �That which is under consideration� is normally a batch (i.e. a unit of food or material used or produced by a food business operator (FBO)) or a trade unit (i.e. a unit of food or material sold by one partner transported to and received by another FBO). In scientific literature the common term for �that which is under consideration� is a Traceable Resource Unit (TRU) (Kim et al. 1999). The TRU is then �the unit that we want to trace� or �the unit that we record information on in our traceability system�. Internal traceability is the traceability within a link or a company. Internal traceability is the backbone of traceability in general; everything else depends on each company in the chain having good systems and good practices when it comes to recording all the relevant internal information. Chain traceability is the traceability between links and companies and it depends on the data recorded in the internal traceability system being transmitted and then read and understood in the next link in the chain. For an illustration of the relationship between internal traceability and chain traceability see Figure 1.  Figure 1 Internal versus chain traceability (TraceFood 2008)  4  3.1.2 Traceability systems and their components For traceability we want to �access any or all information relating to that which is under consideration� so this means that the information recorded in the first link of the chain must somehow be made available in (or transported to) the next link of the chain. This is what the traceability system does; it makes sure that the recorded information is made available elsewhere and it is not lost. This means that if we want to describe or analyse the properties of a traceability system we need to distinguish clearly between the following component types: � The systems and processes that relate to the identification of the TRUs which includes choosing a code deciding on uniqueness and granularity of the code and selecting how to associate the identifier with the TRU. � The systems and processes that relate to the documentation of the transformations in the chain which includes recording of the TRU transformations1 the weights or percentages and the related metadata. � The recording of the attributes of the TRU which can basically be anything that describes the TRU (e.g. attributes of the producing FBO origin of the TRU description of the TRU measurements taken on the TRU process parameters recorded when the TRU was produced etc). The components of a traceability system are illustrated in Figure 2.  Figure 2 The components of a traceability system (Olsen & Borit 2018) 3.1.3 Drivers of traceability systems Different purposes/drivers for implementing a traceability system trigger different expectations in producers and consumers that do not always correspond to the traceability system in use. Table 1 summarises different characteristics of traceability systems including drivers for implementing these.  1 A transformation is an instant or a duration of time where at a given location a process uses a set of inputs (TRUs) to generate outputs (new TRUs).   5  Table 1 Traceability systems: purpose/driver objective attributes standard and example (Borit & Olsen 2016).

There are methods and instruments for testing the veracity of claims related to biochemical food properties and these claims are particularly relevant because of the potential food safety implications if an erroneous claim is made. These methods include DNA-based analyses stable isotope and trace element analyses analysis of lipid profiles high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy metabolite profiling chemical profiling proteomics and many more. Collectively these methods are referred to as �analytical methods�. What they have in common is that they analyse a food item sample and conclude with respect to the value of one or a set of biochemical food item properties. Properties that to some degree can be verified by analytical methods include species geographical origin (broadly) process  6  status (e.g. fresh or frozen) presence of additives some aspects of organic production remaining shelf life and some others depending on the type of food item. While the list of food item properties that can be verified analytically is extensive and growing as the methods and technologies improve it is worth noting that this is only a small subset of the properties recorded in a traceability system. Analytical methods cannot tell you who the owner of the TRU is or the name of the farm or farmer or the route the TRU took in the supply chain or whether the production was ethical of fair trade or similar. While practitioners and publications sometimes refer to these types of methods as �methods for traceability� that is inaccurate at least in relation to most definitions of traceability (including the one chosen here) because they do not deal with �recorded identifications�. What these methods can be used for is to verify some of the claims in the traceability system. It is important to keep in mind that a traceability system is made up of statements that are claimed to be true but we do not know for sure that they actually are true so that is something we need to check. This means that analytical methods are very important when we are dealing with traceability but these methods do not in themselves provide traceability. What they do provide is a way of verifying most of the claims relating to biochemical attributes of the food item in question. While these claims are only a subset of the total number of claims in a traceability system they are among the most important ones because if there is a food safety problem related to a food item it will be detectable through application of analytical methods and food safety as we have seen is a strong driver for implementing a traceability system. 3.1.5 Traceability and chain of custody �Chain of custody� (CoC) is a term related to �  and sometimes confused with traceability and in this report it is useful to clarify the distinction between the terms. CoC encompasses the responsibility for and control of inputs and outputs as they move through each step in the relevant supply chain and a chain of custody system is the set of measures designed to implement a CoC including documentation of the measures taken. There are several different models for implementing CoC systems including identity preserved segregation and mass balance but to describe each of these is beyond the scope of this study. The main differences between traceability and CoC are summarised in Table 2. Table 2 Main differences between traceability and chain of custody (CoC) (after (Borit & Olsen 2016))  Traceability Chain of custody (CoC) Objective To associate recorded data with TRUs; to document what happens To prevent mixing that violates the CoC requirements; to document that no such mixing has occurred Of what? Anything With respect to some particular property which the CoC is in relation to often origin or ecolabel status The traced unit A batch or a trade unit (the TRU) The units with the same CoC identifier Mix/join units Yes but must be documented Only the units with the same CoC identifier After mix/join New unit and new identifier created Considered same unit and receiving the same CoC identifier 3.1.6 Traceability and transparency Being directly linked to trust building among stakeholders transparency is a critical element in risk communication (Hofstede 2004; Renn 2008). Transparency of a supply chain is the degree of shared understanding of � and access to product-related information as requested by a supply chain�s  7  stakeholders without loss noise delay or distortion (Hofstede 2004). Nevertheless transparency and traceability are not the same thing because the latter only sets the framework for the former (EgelsZand�n et al. 2014). A good traceability system can provide product-related information to stakeholders with little loss noise or delay but when it comes to distortion one has to remember that a traceability system basically contains mostly unverified claims and if we want transparency we also need some mechanisms for verifying the data (see Section 3.1.4). A traceability system can provide a coherent overview of all the raw materials ingredients transformations processes and products in the supply chain and one cannot really have transparency without traceability but for transparency some other components are needed as well. While the concept of traceability is quite generic and could be summarised as �keep a record of what you are doing in the chain� transparency has a specific application and target audience in mind (e.g. general public vs. decision-makers). 3.2 Blockchain and blockchain technology 3.2.1 Blockchain definition A blockchain is type of database that contains a digital recording of the history of some transactions. While databases and database systems come in a wide variety of structures and architectures the blockchain data structure is more narrowly defined and blockchain systems have several features that set them apart from traditional digital ledgers or relational databases. Blockchain systems are normally distributed across a network of computers thus not centrally managed and the transactions within a blockchain are shared among all the participants of the blockchain network. The transactions are checked and validated through a consensus mechanism before they become part of the blockchain and consensus is required so all the blockchain participants agree on the �truth� of the blockchain that is the blockchain that contains all the valid and executed transactions. By linking transactions cryptographically to previous transactions data immutability is secured; meaning that changing or tampering with the data becomes (practically) impossible. One of the main advantages of a blockchain is that transactions can be traced back all the way to the start of the blockchain so that it can provide info of an asset on the blockchain and inform how this asset has originated and changed over time. Figure 3 shows a graphical representation of how a blockchain system can work; from creating a transaction to validating that transaction to finally appending the transaction to the blockchain.  Figure 3 Graphical representation of a blockchain system (Blasetti 2017).  8  Normally blockchain implementations are based on five basic principles that underly its technology (Lansiti & Lakhani 2017) see list below. However while the blockchain technology is typically viewed from the perspective of a public blockchain � and commonly tied to its use in cryptocurrencies � it does not mean that the blockchain technology is exclusively tied to the characteristics found in such systems. 1. Distributed database a. Each user in the network has access to the full database and all its transactions. b. No single user controls the database. c. Every user can verify the transactions directly. 2. Peer-to-peer transmission a. Communications between users in the blockchain happens directly without the use of an intermediary. b. Each user stores and broadcasts information to the full network. 3. Transparency with pseudo-anonymity a. Every transaction on the blockchain is visible to anyone who has access to the blockchain. b. Each user has a unique address (typically a public-key) that identifies them. c. Users can be anonymous or can choose to reveal their identity. d. Transactions occur between user addresses. 4. Irreversibility of records a. Once a transaction is stored into the blockchain it cannot be altered. b. Transactions within blocks are linked to other blocks. c. Algorithms are used to make sure transactions are recorded permanently are chronologically ordered and are available to all users on the network. 5. Computational logic a. Blockchain transactions can be tied to computational logic and can thus programmed. b. Users can set up algorithms to trigger transactions between nodes. Care should be taken when looking at the usability and applicability of the blockchain technology. In many cases the advantages of the blockchain technology are almost always linked to public blockchains such as found within the bitcoin cryptocurrency blockchain. The blockchain technology as proposed by Satoshi Nakamoto (Nakamoto 2008) (the inventor of the bitcoin cryptocurrency) is an open source technology. Anyone can fork the code and alter it according to his or her own use case. For instance developing a blockchain technology for a restricted set of users would change the technology into a more centralised ledger system. Since the inception of blockchain one of the core promises of blockchain technology has been decentralisation. However as the technology matures many have come to acknowledge that there must be trade-offs in practice�even calling decentralization a myth. No business can be fully centralised or decentralised without compromising in another area such as security privacy performance or scalability. This is an important consideration when determining the best blockchain approach for any use case. Understanding the differences between public and private blockchains is crucial to understanding the kind of trade-offs necessary to consider when developing a blockchain solution.  9  3.2.2 Blockchain characteristics Blockchain implementations normally have the following four main characteristics: decentralisation persistency anonymity and auditability (Zheng et al. 2017; Wang et al. 2018). Decentralisation In a traditional centralised transaction system each transaction needs to be validated by a central trusted agency such as a bank. Validation is required to make sure transactions are authenticated. This validation process can result in cost and performance bottlenecks at the central servers. With blockchain technology transactions within the blockchain network can be performed between two users without the need for authentication by a single central authority or agent. In doing so blockchain can reduce the server costs and mitigate the performance bottlenecks at the central server. Persistency Each transaction that is broadcasted throughout the blockchain network needs to be confirmed and recorded in blocks that will then be distributed to the whole network. As a result any node in the blockchain network will have a copy of the blockchain. This also means that any node will validate the block and check the validity of the transactions it contains making tampering of the data (nearly) impossible. Falsification of data in terms of inconsistencies with existing blocks can easily be detected. Anonymity Users interact with the blockchain network by using a generated address. This address is completely removed from a physical address or an address tied to a specific user account. Blockchain users can effortless create a multitude of accounts avoiding any form of identifying exposure. A high degree of privacy is achieved when creating blockchain transactions although a perfect privacy preservation has been shown to not be possible. For instance public keys transactions and therefore balances are visible to the whole network resulting in some form of identity detection (see (Meiklejohn et al. 2013; Kosba et al. 2016)). Auditability All transactions on the blockchain are validated and recorded with a timestamp. This makes it possible to check the veracity of previous records and verify existing ones as the history of transactions all the way up to the genesis block (first block of transactions) are maintained and accessible. This characteristic of the blockchain improves traceability and transparency of the data stored in the blockchain by ensuring that information once recorded is never overwritten or lost. 3.2.3 Blockchain types Public vs. private vs. consortium/federated blockchain architecture  General considerations Currently the blockchain system can be categorised into three types: (1) public blockchain (2) private blockchain and (3) consortium or federated blockchain (sometimes also referred to as hybrid blockchains). This section describes some differences between the three types of blockchains from a more general perspective. Public blockchains Public blockchain protocols based on the �proof of work� consensus algorithms are open source and not permissioned. This means that anyone can download the public blockchain technology and start  10  running a public node on his or her local device validate transactions within the network and participate in the consensus process (the process of creating new blocks that are then added to the blockchain) without permission. Anyone can also send transactions to the blockchain network and if valid can see them stored permanently in the blockchain. In addition anyone can read the transactions listed on the blockchain for instance with a public block explorer. Typically these transactions are anonymous or pseudo-anonymous. Examples of public blockchains are Bitcoin (bitcoin.org) Ethereum (ethereum.org) Monero (monero.org) Dash (dash.org) Litecoin (litecoin.org) and Dogecoin (dogecoin.com). Public blockchain technology has the potential to disrupt current business models through disintermediation. In addition there is no need to maintain servers or system admins which radically reduces the costs of creating and running decentralised applications. Consortium or federated blockchains Consortium or federated blockchains are typically managed by a group of people entities or trusted authorities. In essence joining the blockchain network is restricted and it is only granted to a selected set of nodes. This is one of the main differences when comparing it to a public blockchain where any person with access to the Internet can participate in the process of verifying transactions and creating new blocks. Consortium blockchains are faster (higher scalability) and provide more transaction privacy. Such blockchain types are typically used in the banking sector. The consensus process is controlled by a pre-selected set of nodes; for example one might imagine a consortium of 15 financial institutions each of which operates a node and of which 10 must sign every block in order for the block to be valid. The right to read the blockchain may be public or restricted to the participants. Examples of consortium blockchain are R3 (Banks) EWF (Energy) B3i (Insurance) and Corda. Successful implementations of consortium blockchains can reduce transaction costs reduce data redundancies replace legacy systems simplify document handling and create full compliance mechanisms. There is still debate whether consortium blockchains systems can actually be defined as a blockchain. Private blockchains A private blockchain is regarded as a centralised network since it is fully controlled by one organization. With private blockchains write permission to the blockchain is commonly kept centralised to one organisation. Reading the blockchain may be (partly) public or restricted to a selected few; for example by being invited to join the network or having granted access. A private blockchain is almost always a permissioned blockchain. Private blockchains are thus highly restricted. The access control mechanism can vary for instance existing participants can invite new members a regulatory authority can issue a license to participate or a group of members can make such decisions. Private blockchains are a way of taking advantage of blockchain technology by setting up groups and participants who can verify transactions internally. In contrast to public blockchains members who control the blockchain are at risk for security breaches similar to a centralised system. Private blockchains have their uses in scalability state compliance of data privacy rules and other regulatory issues. Examples of private blockchains are MONAX and Multichain. Private blockchains similar to consortium blockchains are argued not to be proper blockchains.  11  Comparison of the blockchain types A comparison between the different types of blockchains is a challenging one especially since the technology has not yet matured and important classification criteria are not yet established. The three types of blockchains are compared here based on six criteria: consensus determination read permission immutability efficiency centralisation and consensus process. Consensus determination Consensus determination relates to the validation of a new block�including all its transactions�and demonstrates to the blockchain network that some form of block validation has been established. A consensus is required to allow the full network to accept the new block and its transactions into the blockchain and it creates a starting point from where subsequent new blocks can build upon. In a public blockchain each node could take part in the consensus process there is no entry requirement to mine blocks. Within a consortium blockchain only a selected set of nodes are responsible for validating new blocks typically nodes that have been granted some form of authority or trust. Within private blockchains one organisation or trusted authority is fully responsible for validating the blocks and the underlying consensus mechanism. Read permission Read permission relates to the visibility of the transactions within the blockchain. Within a public blockchain anyone can view the transactions; from the first all the way up to the latest. There is no restriction in terms of reading the transactions. However with private or consortium blockchains the read permission is regulated and can be constructed in a variety of ways. For instance only some transactions are visible to everyone or some transactions are visible to some users. Read permissions are up to the trusted authorities who maintain the blockchain. Immutability Immutability relates to the ability of transactions or values within the blockchain being altered or tampered with. For example a value x of transaction y in block z will be changed to a different value. The public blockchain technology is often characterised for its high degree of immutability since transactions are stored in different nodes in the distributed network which makes it nearly impossible to tamper with a public blockchain. One of the current trends in mining blocks within a public blockchain for example with the bitcoin cryptocurrency blockchain is that miners join their computational power in mining pools which when they have more than 51% of the computational power of the network could potentially endanger the immutability of the whole blockchain network. For private and consortium blockchains immutability is low since the majority of block validators can easily reverse or tamper with the blockchain if they choose to do so. Efficiency Efficiency relates to the handling of transactions and blocks within the blockchain network or simply put how the flow of data propagates throughout the network. Within a public blockchain the propagation or broadcasting of transactions and blocks takes more time typically because there are more nodes in the network. When taking network safety into consideration restrictions on public blockchain would be much more strict. As a result transaction throughput is limited and the latency is high. Within consortium and private blockchains the small number of validators could make data propagation more efficient.  12  Degree of centralisation A centralised network relates to control that is carried out by a single entity for instance a trusted party. The main difference between the three types of blockchain types is that a public blockchain is fully decentralised; meaning that no single authority handles or controls the blockchain network. The consortium blockchain is partially centralised and private blockchain is fully centralised as it is controlled by a single group. Consensus process The consensus process relates to the process whereby new blocks and its transactions are validated and are appended to the existing blockchain. This �new� validated block becomes the starting point from where subsequent new validated blocks will be linked to. The validation process is the consensus process and the mechanisms behind the process itself can take on many variations which will be described later on. Within a public blockchain anyone can join the consensus process and start validating blocks. There is no entry requirement other than hardware to be able to execute the validation mechanism (such as solving computational puzzles). In contrast with a consortium and private blockchain participating in the consensus process is restricted; a permission is required to join the process. Since the consensus process determines what new transactions are being entered into the blockchain within a private and consortium blockchain typically a validation node needs to be certified to take part in this process. A summary of the three blockchain types with their six characteristics is given Table 3. Table 3 Overview of blockchain types  Public Consortium/Federated Private Consensus determination everyone selected (few) single authority Read permission public public partly public restricted public partly public restricted Immutability nearly impossible possible with majority of validators possible Efficiency low high high Centralised no partially yes Consensus process permissionless permissioned permissioned  It is important to note that when choosing a specific type of blockchain it does not necessarily mean that one is better than the other. In other words what might work for one might not necessarily work for another. The implementation of the blockchain type is highly case dependent. Presently there are no real standards to measure the quality of the blockchain against which would also mean that relying on the blockchain vendor�s pros and cons might not necessarily paint the right picture. Other criteria not mentioned above might include governance trust and resources aspects of the blockchain. In essence the choice for a type of blockchain would for a large part depend on (1) who is allowed to participate in the blockchain network and execute the consensus protocol and (2) who is able to view of the content of the blockchain such as the transactions. Consensus mechanism In blockchain a consensus mechanism is required to enable the nodes in the blockchain network to decide on which new transactions to add to the blockchain. This means to decide what the new and updated version of the blockchain will be or more specifically what new blocks will be added to the chain. In a (public) blockchain typically all nodes are seen as untrustworthy nodes and to reach  13  consensus within the blockchain the problem can be framed as a version of the so called Byzantine Generals problem. In short the Byzantine army consists of different groups of generals with their soldiers surrounding a city. The generals even though they are all surrounding the same city are not in the same place. To successfully attack the city all generals must attack the city. Thus an attack would fail if only a part of the generals attack the city. Generals can communicate through messengers and they need to reach an agreement whether to attack or not. The problem is that some of the generals might be traitors and they can send different messages to different generals. This scenario can be seen as a trustless environment and the challenge is to reach consensus among the generals. The Byzantine Generals problem is analogous to a (public) blockchain network where nodes in the network need to agree on the state of the ledger; agreeing on one version of the ledger. Various protocols to reach consensus are developed which are described below (Zheng et al. 2017). Proof of work (PoW) Proof of work (PoW) is the consensus mechanism used within the public bitcoin blockchain. PoW provides a way to ensure that some computational work has been performed to validate transactions and to allow the new block to be appended to the blockchain. In essence the computational work involves solving a cryptographic puzzle that takes time and computing power to solve. Once the puzzle is solved other nodes within the network can easily verify the answer. Technically the cryptographic puzzle is calculating a hash value of the transactions that make up the new block. Why solving a puzzle? It provides a mechanism to make sure transactions are valid and that bitcoin �money� is not spent twice this is the double-spending problem. By making sure some form of computational work has been put into a new block thus making sure that there is only one version of the ledger blocks that contain invalid or false transactions cannot quickly be added since it required much computational power to validate the block with the answer of the cryptographic puzzle. The nodes that calculate such puzzles are called miners and they are the ones responsible for bundling transactions into blocks and adding those blocks to the chain of previous blocks (hence the blockchain). One of the major downsides of the PoW consensus mechanism is the enormous amount of energy used by the computers in the network to solve the cryptographic puzzle. In addition since the cryptographic puzzle is difficult to solve it takes time to validate/create and append new blocks to the blockchain. Though this ensures that no invalid blocks are quickly added to the blockchain in a consortium or private blockchain there is no need for such delay of block creation. The number of nodes in non-public blockchains is typically an order of magnitudes lower and there is usually direct network visibility. Slowing down the creation of new blocks through PoW is not required or not to that level to achieve stability. In private and consortium blockchains the identities of members are known. There is a restriction on participation execution of the consensus mechanism and maintaining the shared ledger. There is no incentive to motivate nodes to join the network and to perform mining (miners in public blockchains such as bitcoin are rewarded by some value of the cryptocurrency which is absent in blockchains not build around cryptocurrencies). Because members are not anonymous and networks are usually not exposed to hostile public internet environment the requirements on the cost of immutability are weaker. The blockchain does not have to be guarded by the enormous cost of energy. For immutability integrity through the hash chain and shared distributed ledger is usually sufficient. Differences in the environment and known identity of network participants along with their defined roles remove the need for the high-cost protection through the PoW mining. Typically more emphasis is put on transaction throughput fault tolerance overall efficiency and restriction of access to the blockchain  14  data. These differences make PoW unsuitable for a consortium or private blockchain especially when high throughput of transactions is wanted. In addition the enormous waste of energy resources associated with PoW resulted in the development of other consensus mechanisms such as proof of stake (PoS) delegated proof of stake (DPoS) and Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance Algorithm (PBFT). We describe the workings of PoS DPoS and PBFT below including a variation of PoW and PoS called proof of activity (PoA). Proof of Stake (PoS) One of the most common alternatives to PoW is called proof of stake (PoS). PoS eliminates the need to buy expensive and powerful computer hardware to solve cryptographic puzzles in a short amount of time. The PoS miners who are called validators are investing in coins of the system. The coins within the system exist from the creation of the blockchain and are not rewarded by mining blocks. Instead blocks are simply validated. Validators can be seen as stakeholders hence the word �stake� in the name. The incentive to validate blocks comes only from the transactions fees linked to the transactions and no �coin� is created when building the new blocks. Such systems can be seen as performing virtual mining. The blockchain network selects based on the amount of stake a member is willing to put into the system an individual to confirm the validity of the transactions and the creation of the new block. Validators who place (proportionally) more stake are more likely to be chosen to create and append the new block to the blockchain. This is one of the main differences compared to the PoW mechanism. There is no need to solve computational puzzles as quickly as possible but instead the system decides who can solve the computational puzzle (without the need to outrace other miners). Once a validator has been selected and the block validated typically the other validators in the network will perform some check to ensure the block can be appended to the blockchain. Different proof-of-stake systems vary in how they handle this. There are some implementations where every node in the system has to sign off on a block until a majority vote is reached while in other systems a random group of signers is chosen. Validators who want to forge the system risk losing their stake which is typically much higher than the reward obtained from all the transactions fees. Rather than calling the validation process mining it is called minting within PoW. It may appear that PoS is a reasonable replacement for PoW as it eliminates the need for massive amounts of computational power. With PoW although initially started as fully decentralised (many individual nodes) it slowly moved into the direction where many nodes act as groups known as pools making the consensus mechanism less decentralised. PoS mitigates this effect and can largely be operated decentralised. However there are similar problems found in PoS that need to be solved first before the consensus mechanism can largely be adopted by a blockchain system. When evaluating the way PoS works with regards to security the common questions that could arise would be the following: What is to discourage a validator from creating two blocks and claiming two sets of transaction fees? And what is to discourage a signer from signing both of those blocks? This has been called the �nothingat-stake� problem. A participant with nothing to lose has no reason not to behave badly. Additionally since the chance of validating a block increases with the amount of stake invested those who can afford to invest more stake can potentially end up receiving rewards more often. This causes the system to become more centralised a drawback as similar to the centralisation by mining pools with the PoW mechanism.  15  A variation of PoS is called delegated proof of stake (DPoS). The major difference between PoS and DPoS is that there is an overarching entity to represent the participant's stake. In other words participants can now collectively increase their portion of the stake thereby creating a mechanism to help balance out the power of large stakeholders. Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) algorithm The Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) algorithm is a mechanism to solve the problem traditionally known as the Byzantine Generals problem (described earlier) and inherently found in distributed systems with trustless participants. In short each �general� maintains an internal state (ongoing specific information or status). When a �general� receives a message they use the message in conjunction with their internal state to run a computation or operation. This computation in turn tells that individual �general� what to think about the message in question. Then after reaching his individual decision about the new message that �general� shares that decision with all the other �generals� in the system. A consensus decision is determined based on the total decisions submitted by all generals. Three examples of blockchains that rely on the PBFT for consensus are Hyperledger Stellar and Ripple. One of the advantages of a PBFT consensus mechanism is that it requires less effort in term of computational work. Proof of Activity (PoA) Proof of activity (PoA) is a hybrid consensus mechanism that combines proof of work with proof of stake. Mining the blocks is performed in the traditional PoW way with the exception that the block does not contain any transactions (although this depends on the type of implementation). The race to solve to cryptographic puzzle still exists with accompanying need for computational resources. When the puzzle is solved the system switches to proof of stake. Random validators are chosen to sign the new block with those who own more stake have a higher chance of being selected to sign it. After the block has been signed it becomes part of the blockchain and fees are split between the miners and validators who signed off on the block. The downsides of PoW (high energy costs due to enormous computational power) and PoS (double signing of blocks) still exists. 3.2.4 Permissioned vs. permissionless Permissionless A permissionless blockchain is a blockchain where no permission is required to read the blockchain to make transactions to the blockchain and to validate or mine blocks. A permissionless blockchain can also be viewed as a public blockchain with the Bitcoin blockchain network being the most popular example. A major advantage of a permissionless (or public/open) blockchain network is that guarding against bad actors is not required and no access control is needed. This means that applications can be added to the network without the approval or trust of others using the blockchain as a transport layer. Permissioned Permissioned blockchains are blockchains where a permission is required to join the blockchain to have a copy of the blockchain and in some cases to be able to validate blocks. Examples of permissioned blockchains are for instance Hyperledger and R3 Corda. Permissioned blockchains use an access control layer to govern who has access to the network. In contrast to public blockchain networks validators on private blockchain networks are trusted parties chosen by the network owner. There are no anonymous nodes that validate transactions nor nodes that receive mining rewards.  16  Permissioned blockchains do rely on a consensus mechanism to make sure new blocks on the blockchain are validated and that there exists only one version of the truth. The consensus protocol comprises of three basic steps: (1) determine whether to accept or reject a transaction (2) sort all transactions within a time period into a sequence and (3) verify and save into the blockchain. Permissioned blockchains are also called consortium federated or hybrid blockchains. Comparison between permissioned and permissionless blockchain types The comparison between permissioned and permissionless blockchain types in relation to trust and the anonymity of validators is depicted in Figure 4.  Figure 4 Overview of trust levels vs. anonymity of validators within permissioned and permissionless blockchains A permissionless blockchain combined with a public blockchain has a high degree of anonymity of the validators with a low degree of trust in the validators. The consensus mechanism can be a proof of work based implementation. Such blockchain types are suitable for full anonymous systems that have no control mechanism of one single entity or person. Examples are Bitcoin and Monero with full anonymity and decentralisation of mining. A permissioned combined with a public blockchain has a high degree of anonymity of the validators while simultaneously having a high degree of trust in those validators. The consensus mechanism can be a proof of stake-based implementation. Such types are typically more scalable but have a moderate degree of immutability. They are suitable for community governance execution of contracts and private money systems. Examples include Bitshares and Ethereum (with proof of stake implementation) and can evolve in slightly decentralised (a low number of validators have all the stake) but the network becomes fast. A permissioned combined with a private blockchain will have a low degree of anonymity of the validators but they will have a high degree of trust. Consensus mechanism is PBFT based overcoming the need for computation power and energy resources. Such blockchains are applicable to banking fast payment infrastructure corporate usage and are generally used for traceability flexibility and efficient governance of digital assets. Table 4 shows a comparison between public and private blockchains and permissionless and permissioned.  17  Table 4 Overview of characteristics between permissionless/permissioned and public/private blockchains. Adapted from (Carson et al. 2018).  Permissionless Permissioned Public � Anyone can join read write and commit � Hosted on public servers � Anonymous highly resilient � Low scalability � Anyone can join and read � Only authorised and known participants can write and commit � Medium scalability Private � Only authorised participants can join read and write � Hosted on private servers � High scalability � Only authorised participants can join and read � Only the network operator can write and commit � Very high scalability 3.2.5 Blockchain infrastructure Besides the investments made into setting up or developing the blockchain system there are very few additional hardware investments to make that would enable information to be stored onto the blockchain. Where one would store the information in a digital database ledger or supply chain system one can now store their information directly (e.g. application programming interfaces) or indirectly (e.g. web interface) on the blockchain. Besides manual entering data into the system scanners or other electronic reading devices can be used. Data connector application programming interfaces (APIs) allow companies to efficiently upload supply chain data from existing data stores (such as SAP) to their blockchain system for seamless integration of data from enterprise systems to blockchain solutions. Organisations that do not work with enterprise software can enter data through web interfaces. 3.2.6 Blockchain and transparency By using blockchain technology the digital ledger can become more transparent (Nugent et al. 2016; Abeyratne & Monfared 2016; Underwood 2016; Wust & Gervais 2018). Since the blockchain especially in public blockchain types are distributed all network participants have a copy of the same blockchain (i.e. digital ledger). Any new update to the blockchain is governed by a consensus mechanism which enables a high degree of immutability and results in everyone having the same copy of the blockchain�resulting in a high degree of shared understanding. In other words the participants within the blockchain network agree on a single truth of the blockchain and no single participant can make changes or tamper with transactions in the blockchain. This decentralised characteristic of the blockchain creates a high degree of transparency. However blockchain technology is not limited to being just decentralised as the centralised or private blockchains also have some advantages for corporations over the public ones. Private blockchains are useful for corporations who want to use the power of decentralised ledgers to improve the ongoing function. From a technical perspective centralised and decentralised blockchain types are very similar. In both cases the network consists of nodes responsible for storing and securing the digital ledger and they require a consensus mechanism to establish a single ledger. The biggest difference between centralised and decentralised or public and private is the number of nodes that participate in the network and make changes to the network (i.e. create new blocks). In the Bitcoin public blockchain case there are no barriers to entry when it comes to accessing the ledger and taking part in the consensus mechanism to create new blocks. In contrast in consortium or private  18  blockchains (e.g. IBM�s Hyperledger Fabric) typically the organization deploying the blockchain controls many aspects of the blockchain including participation and access. Thus the advantage of centralised blockchains is that it offers more customisability and control over the network resulting in less resources necessary to secure the network making them essentially more environmentally friendly. At the same time since the organization deploying the blockchain can choose what hardware the network runs on they can typically achieve higher overall throughput. A disadvantage of centralised blockchain systems is that they are less secure since there is not as much computing power securing the network as compared to (public) decentralised blockchains. It only requires a few of the nodes hosting the network to collude by amassing enough resources to hack the network. This can cause the blockchain to be less transparent since the degree of shared understanding can more easily be tampered with. This is even worse when the blockchain network is fully centralised thus managed by a single organisation or entity. Within a public blockchain all the information stored within blocks is publicly visible to anyone. This can be made clear by illustrating it with the Bitcoin public blockchain. Public blockchains typically have an explorer; an online chain browser that displays the content of individual blocks accounts balances of addressees and transactions. Bitcoin has many explorers for instance BlockExplorer (blockexplorer.com) or Block Explorer (blockchain.com/explorer) which can be utilised to find information of particular blocks and its content. For example each block contains a summary of when it was created the reference (i.e. hash) to the previous block the solution to the cryptographic puzzle (based on PoW) who mined the block and other information. In addition the transactions are listed that show from which account to which other account Bitcoins were transferred and the amount. Every transaction and every created block since the first genesis block are publicly available and fully transparent. However account holders are listed by their public key addresses (which is also utilised to digitally sign a transaction) which do not reveal the identity of the individual. This in the case of Bitcoin makes the blockchain have a high degree of traceability on the one hand side but are still private on the other hand. In contrast the transactions (or any other type of data) within consortium and private blockchains are commonly not completely visible to the public. Depending on the implementation the information stored on the blockchain can be fully partly or not viewable by the public. Verifying the authenticity of the transaction for an outside party becomes harder. Also since private ledgers commonly are not available for public use they are of little use to anyone besides the corporations that deploy them. Transparency of the transactions is thus lower in such types of blockchains compared to fully public blockchains. An inherent trade-off exists between privacy and transparency within blockchain technology. When the blockchain is fully transparent�in terms of the transactions on the blockchain�anyone can view information stored on the blockchain and by whom that information was added; meaning that no privacy is provided. Likewise a fully private system provides no transparency. However a system can still provide significant privacy-guarantees while making the process of state transitions transparent e.g. a distributed ledger can provide public verifiability of its overall state without leaking information about the state of each individual participant (Wust & Gervais 2018). To achieve privacy in a public system techniques of cryptography can be utilised. However using cryptography comes at a cost of lower efficiency. The cryptocurrency Zerocash (zerocash-project.org) for example makes use of computationally expensive cryptography to provide full anonymity while still providing sufficient transparency to publicly verify the ledger state.  19  4 Application of blockchain technology in the food sector 4.1 Overview of providers of blockchain technology The blockchain technology is open source and free to use adjust and extend in any way. The downside of adopting the original source code is that a successful implementation of the blockchain depends on a full understanding of the underlying code base. However such implementations provide the most degrees of freedom as every aspect of the blockchain can be tailored towards the specific use case. During recent years there is a wide array of approaches to implementing a blockchain technology. Many players have emerged each with their own merits and a couple of implementation types are listed below. Blockchain as a Service (BaaS) The Blockchain as a Service (BaaS) concept can be mapped to the definition of �Software as a Service� (SaaS) which is a software distribution model in which a third-party hosts an application and offers the application�s functionality (i.e. service) through the Internet. Typical examples of SaaS solutions are Google Apps Dropbox Salesforce and Cisco WebEx. This type of service is sometimes called �ondemand software�. A subscription or registration is typically needed to make use of the functionality or service. Other variants are for example platform as a service (PaaS) and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). Blockchain as a service follows the same ideology and it prevents users from developing blockchain systems from scratch. Some of the big cloud providers such as Amazon (with AWS) Microsoft (with Azure) and IBM (with BlueMix) are starting to offer blockchain as a service on their cloud platforms. Users adopting BaaS solutions will benefit from not having to deal with the problems concerning configuration setting up a working blockchain and not needing hardware investments. Amazon AWS blockchain solutions: Amazon offers end-to-end BaaS solutions with a wide range of blockchain frameworks for developing blockchain applications. Examples of frameworks are Hyperledger Fabric Hyperledger Sawtooth Ethereum and Corda. Amazon offers developers a one-click deploy of the underlying blockchain and connectivity to supplemental applications. Microsoft Azure blockchain workbench: Microsoft offers modular pre-configured networks and infrastructure. Development of blockchains can be done by the blockchain workbench. The workbench is a collection of Azure services and capabilities designed to create and deploy blockchain applications to share business processes and data with other organisations. Microsoft provides the infrastructure scaffolding for building blockchain applications allowing developers to focus on creating business logic and smart contracts. Other Azure services can easily be integrated. Examples of blockchain solutions offered are Corda Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric. A solution architecture for supply chain track and trace is also offered. IBM BlueMix Blockchain: IBM offers BaaS on their BlueMix cloud platform. IBM blockchain solution and services are built on Hyperledger technologies which provide the framework and tool set. IBM claim to have successfully implemented over 400 blockchain solutions and their best practices can be found in their enterprise ready blockchain services.  20  Blockchain first A blockchain first implementation works directly with the blockchain tools and stack. A complete assembly is required which makes this type of implementation difficult. The upside is that working directly with the blockchain creates the most degrees of freedom and allows for a high degree of innovation. Typically new blockchain technology provider companies start building their solutions by working directly with the blockchain tools. Examples here include working with the original Bitcoin (github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin) and Ethereum (github.com/ethereum) source code available on Github. Development platforms Several development platforms exists that allow for fast development of a blockchain implementation. Such platform focus not on a specific blockchain technology but allow for rapid development with a strong focus on the blockchain programmability. Examples include BlockApps (blockapps.net) Blockstream (blockstream.com) Monax (monax.io) Parity (parity.io) Hyperledger (hyperledger.org) and Tendermint (tendermint.com). Vertical solutions Vertical blockchain solutions are industry specific and are based on private blockchain or ledger infrastructure. Some vertical blockchain solutions are arguably not a proper blockchain solution but more a distributed ledger solution (which can be viewed as a subset of the blockchain technology). Examples include Axoni (axoni.com) Chain (chain.com) Clearmatics (clearmatics.com) Digital Asset Holdings (digitalasset.com) itBit (itbit.com) and R3 (r3.com). APIs & Overlays This approach uses the blockchain as an asset ownership or identity-binding infrastructure and it is typically used for a specific purpose for example chains of proof ownership rights title registries or other specific services with a built-in trust-based component. Examples include Blockstack (blockstack.org) Factom (factom.com) Open Assets (openassets.org) and Tierion (tierion.com). 4.2 Overview of existing applications of blockchain technology in the food sector There are relatively many applications (test / trials) of blockchain in food chains addressing specific issues (e.g. traceability) or sectors. However there is a lack of common technology that can connect different blockchains (Ciaian 2018). Most existing blockchain systems for traceability management have been developed since 2015 (Galvez et al. 2018). Table 5 summarises some of the blockchain technology initiatives/projects in the agricultural and farming food-supply chain together with the objective(s) of the implementation of this technology. For a summary of topics that have been addressed in current research on blockchain for agriculture see (Bermeo-Almeida et al. 2018).  21  Table 5 Selected applications of blockchain technology in the agricultural and farming food-supply chain Goods/Products Initiative/Project/Company involved Objectives Agri-food AgriOpenData (Galvez et al. 2018) Allow quality and digital identity to be certified Agri-food Supply Chain Traceability System for China Based on RFID & Blockchain Technology (Galvez et al. 2018) Trusted information throughout the agri-food supply chain Beef �Paddock to plate� project BeefLedger; JD.com (Kamilaris et al. 2018) Food traceability Beer Downstream (Kamilaris et al. 2018) Food traceability Chicken Gogochicken; Grass Roots Farmers Cooperative; OriginTrail (Kamilaris et al. 2018); ZhongAn (Ciaian 2018) Food traceability food safety concerns of urban consumers Coffee FairChain coffee: Bext360 in partnership with Moyee Coffee (Ciaian 2018) Traceability transparency of the value added Fish Provenance (Galvez et al. 2018) Auditable system Fresh food Ripe (Galvez et al. 2018) Enabling data transparency and transfer from farm to fork Fruits FruitChains (Galvez et al. 2018) Public immutable ordered ledger of records Grains AgriDigital (Kamilaris et al. 2018) Financial Large enterprises IBM (Galvez et al. 2018) Food tracking project Mangoes Walmart Kroger IBM (Kamilaris et al. 2018) Food traceability Olive oil OlivaCoin (Ciaian 2018; Kamilaris et al. 2018) Financial Small farmers support Orange juice Alber Heijn & Refresco (International Supermarket News 2018) Show customers how and by whom products are made Pork Walmart Kroger IBM (Kamilaris et al. 2018) Food traceability Pork Arc-net (Galvez et al. 2018) Brand protection and security through transparency Scotch Whisky CaskCoin (Ciaian 2018) Investing in maturing Scotch Whisky Soybean HSBC & Cargill; ING & Louis Dreyfus Co.

Is it still a steak dinner if you serve fries instead of a baked potato? Is it still a steak dinner if you serve it with pepper sauce or bearnaise sauce? Is it still a steak dinner if you serve it on paper plates rather than on proper dinner plates? Most people would say yes to all these questions; it is still a steak dinner even if you change the context and the serving options. You cannot however take away the steak; then you would no longer call it a steak dinner. The challenge when analysing blockchain is that the term is traditionally associated with one or a very limited set of �serving options�. A block is a just set of recorded transactions and a blockchain is just a chain of such blocks linked in way so that each block refers to the previous block in a way that makes it impossible to change any part of the previous block (or rather it would be immediately discovered if you made a change). For a computer scientist a blockchain is simply a data structure similar to a linked list where hashes rather than pointers are used to refer to the previous link in the chain. This is the �steak� analogy; if you do not have this data structure then what you have should not be called a blockchain. What then are the �serving options�? Any article on this subject will tell you that blockchain implementations are online distributed (multiple copies of the database / the blockchain exist) that there is a consensus mechanism to decide how to synchronise these multiple copies and that there is a signing process which uses public and private keys to ensure identification and to enable encryption. This is all true for bitcoin which as previously indicated is a public blockchain but is it necessarily true for all block chain implementations including hybrid blockchains and private blockchains? The answer at least in principle is no; all these additional attributes traditionally assigned to blockchain implementations are just implementation choices. Other implementation choices could have been made and the underlying data structure would still be a blockchain. A programmer on a standalone offline computer could write a blockchain implementation based on a single version of the blockchain with no consensus mechanism needed no signing process needed and no encryption needed. In principle this should be called a blockchain because the underlying data structure for the implementation as well as the data recorded would be identical to a (single copy of) an online public blockchain implemented in the traditional way with a consensus mechanism a signing mechanism and encryption using public and private keys. This is what makes it difficult to compare blockchain-based traceability system with a traditional electronic traceability system which normally uses a relational database as the underlying data structure. Strictly speaking the only difference between the two systems is the structure of the underlying database and that means that while inherent differences between the implementations exist these differences are fairly small and relate to the immutable inherently consistent nature of the blockchain data structure. This is however not how blockchain implementations are usually described or analysed. Rather than comparing blockchain against non-blockchain implementations most analyses compare online against offline implementations or distributed against centralised single copy implementations or encrypted against non-encrypted signatures.   23  As an example a statement that is repeated in many articles on applications of blockchain in the food industry is the following �In a Walmart blockchain project it took 2.2 seconds to trace mangoes to the farm. Without blockchain this would take the retailer 6 days 18 hours and 26 minutes to identify the original farm� (Collak 2018). Let us accept the first statement that using a traceability system based on blockchain technology it took 2.2 seconds to trace mangoes back to the farm. However the second statement is clearly untrue and cannot serve as a basis for evaluating the relevance of the blockchain solution. It might be true that in the (apparently very inefficient) previous traceability system it took more than 6 days to trace the mangoes back to the farm but that has nothing to do with the system being based on a relational database (or whatever kind of database) rather than blockchain; it is related to the change from fragmented non-integrated possibly partly manual data to online distributed harmonised and connected data. As part of the comparison of blockchain-based vs. traditional electronic food traceability systems it is worth enumerating some of these �serving options� in Table 6. Table 6 Attributes and implementation options for traditional vs. blockchain-based traceability systems   Traditional electronic traceability system Electronic traceability system based on blockchain technology Underlying database Relational database (usually) Blockchain Immutable database? Possible by setting �append only� flag on database but very unusual Yes Single copy of database? Normally yes. Traditional databases often use client-server network architecture where a single master copy of the database is stored on a centralised server. No normally multiple copies (but strictly speaking this is an implementation option) Consensus mechanism? Needed if there are multiple copies of the database unusual Yes (but strictly speaking this is an implementation option) Online? Cloud-based? Not uncommon for large companies and for modern chain traceability systems Yes (but strictly speaking this is an implementation option) User authentication In a client-server implementation the server authenticates a client�s credentials Based on cryptography with private keys and public keys (but strictly speaking this is an implementation option)  So what does this mean? Should we compare a blockchain implementation to a �bad� traditional traceability system to an average one or to one that is as similar to a blockchain implementation as possible with all the same implementation options? There is no clear answer to this question; it depends on what you want to measure and it depends on what you want to achieve by making the comparison. If you want to argue for the desirability of blockchain solutions you compare blockchain solutions to fairly bad traditional traceability systems like in the Walmart example. A better approach is to analyse the attributes and implementation options separately and indicate pros and cons of each.    24  Suitability of database A traditional database can store anything and it is normally state-based i.e. it stores the current state or value of the data. A blockchain stores transactions and as transformations in a (food) supply chain are similar to transactions the blockchain is well suited for storing data related to food (or product) traceability. Data quality and veracity Ensuring quality and veracity of recorded data is a significant challenge for both types of systems; there is a risk of �garbage in garbage out�. Accidental errors in recorded data are likely to be equally frequent in the two types of systems. Deliberate fraud however is probably less likely (but certainly still possible) in a blockchain-based system as the person committing the fraud will know that if fraud is discovered in a blockchain-based system the provider of the fraudulent statement can be unambiguously and quickly identified and this obviously increases the risk of being caught. Immutability integrity and transparency In a traditional database data elements can be overwritten although it is not uncommon to keep a version log indicating who did the overwriting when and where. The data recorded in a blockchain is immutable by design which means that we know that recorded data has never been overwritten. Thus a traditional database has no built-in integrity; it stores the latest recorded (or claimed) state of each data element independently. In a blockchain implementation the state of each variable is not stored; instead all the transactions that led up to this state is stored. Using a feed silo as an example in a traditional database the current amount and type of feed would be stored (probably also the previous feed transactions to and from the silo). In a blockchain implementation the current amount of feed would not be stored; only the entire list of transactions to and from the silo. In a traditional database the current feed level recorded in the database would be an unsubstantiated claim. In a blockchain implementation the current feed level would be calculated by going through all the recorded transactions thus providing more transparency and integrity to the stated feed level value. Confidentiality While a blockchain implementation especially a private blockchain can provide data confidentiality that is not what it was designed for. In a blockchain implementation confidentiality and tiered data access protocols are designed externally and on an ad-hoc basis. Blockchain scores highly on transparency and in this context transparency and confidentiality are to some degree mutually exclusive qualities; if you score well on one you cannot really score well on the other. Trust Trust is not a trivial attribute to evaluate in this context because the different implementations treat the concept of trust differently. In a traditional traceability system you are asked to trust the owner of the system and the database and if anything turns out to be wrong (false claims food fraud etc.) the reputation of the owner of the database (and in practise the brand) suffers. Blockchain was designed to work without trusting any particular organisation; the trust in the veracity of the data would be supplied by the design of the blockchain system. While this in itself is a useful attribute it is not really how trust in the food sector works. To remove the need to trust any organisation and to democratise the responsibility for data veracity is relevant in a purely virtual system but that is not what the food sector is. Brand owners will still need to be trusted both to provide data but most of all for producing safe nutritious and high-quality food. While using a blockchain-based system  25  provides no disadvantage in relation to trust the inherent blockchain quality of �not needing to trust any single organisation� is not really applicable in the food sector. Speed and efficiency Obviously this integrity comes at a great cost. A blockchain implementation will always be slower than a traditional implementation because in addition to supporting the functionality that a normal database supports (writing and reading data) it also needs to verify signatures / identities using cryptography and it needs to execute a consensus algorithm to determine which blocks gets added to the blockchain during the next update. This is in addition to the inefficiency related to the built-in redundancy in the blockchain where there are multiple copies of the database and where all transactions since the creation of the blockchain is stored and accessed. Robustness The redundancy has an upside which is robustness. Robustness is an indication of how sensitive the data and the database is to mistakes errors or incidents including things like power-outs hacking server crashes and malfunctioning software or hardware. In a traditional system robustness is provided by external processes and these may vary; significant amounts of data may be lost if something goes wrong and the protective measures are not in place. In a blockchain-based system a degree of robustness is inherent in the system both for the state of the data which can be recreated by traversing the recorded transactions and for the database which is normally online and duplicated many times. Interoperability In principle interoperability i.e. how well different systems exchange information could be seen as independent from the traditional / blockchain choice. In practice however this is not the case. As indicated above a traditional electronic traceability system has a large number of implementation options and the relational database can be structured in many different ways. At least for now blockchain implementations are more homogenous in that they all store transactions rather than data element values they are all online they are all immutable they all employ cryptography for verifying identity etc. The fact that blockchain systems are more homogenous makes them more interoperable and in fact many of the reported blockchain success stories are based on the improvement in operability and data sharing along the supply chain rather than on any of the blockchain attributes in itself. For traditional traceability systems to become (more) interoperable would depend on widespread adoption of standards both for Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and for data content; unfortunately there are too many competing standards in this area so the current level of interoperability is fairly low. In this report we highlight improved interoperability as the most important benefit of using a blockchain-based electronic traceability system in the food industry. This benefit is not strictly speaking based on any particular characteristic of the blockchain structure or database; it is based on the fact that interoperability between blockchain implementations are simpler because blockchain implementations are more similar than traditional electronic traceability implementations which can be built on a wide range of operating principles system architectures and database types.  26  6 Cost benefits and practical considerations relating to blockchainbased systems To evaluate costs benefits and to consider some practical considerations we have evaluated how a blockchain-enabled food traceability system may be used in supply chains for food products in general and in the supply chains for red meat and for herbs and spices in particular. We have also indicated how authorities seeking to get access to food item properties and to verify the veracity of the associated claims may utilise a blockchain-based system. 6.1 Food product supply chains in general Based on the evaluation criteria identified in the previous section the overall comparison of a traditional traceability system with a blockchain-based system is indicated in Table 7. Red colour indicates a disadvantage or an existing challenge light green colour indicates a small advantage for the system type in question and deep green colour indicates a significant advantage. Table 7 Costs and benefits of blockchain-based systems in the food product supply chains in general Comparison criteria Traditional electronic traceability system Electronic traceability system based on blockchain technology Suitability of database Records (claimed) variable states versatile Records transactions well suited for recording transformations Data quality and veracity Data provider must check and vouch for data quality and veracity Data provider must check and vouch for data quality and veracity but fraud frequency may be lower as risk of getting caught is higher Immutability integrity and transparency Data elements can be overwritten; needs additional recording (transaction log or similar) to document this Only the transactions are recorded which means a higher level of integrity and transparency of the claimed values Confidentiality Easy to integrate tiered levels of access Can be done but to some degree it goes against the philosophy of what a blockchain implementation is meant to support Trust Based on trust in the food business and the brand Still based on trust in the food business and the brand but trust may be higher because of higher degree of data integrity and transparency Robustness Duplication back-up and other means of providing robustness must be provided by external processes Robustness and duplication of data is built into the system Speed and efficiency As good as you can get Significant overhead related to duplication error checking consensus mechanisms and calculating the state of variables based on transactions Interoperability There is a plethora of systems implementations and database structures there are a number of standards for TRU identification and Electronic Data Interchange and there are very few standards defining how the recorded data elements should be named and measured. This means that system interoperability (exchange of data) is a big problem. Blockchain-based systems are less diverse; they all record transactions (transformations) rather than state values and they are all immutable. Interoperability and data interchange between blockchain-based food traceability systems is easier than between existing systems any many of the success stories reported is because a higher degree of interoperability has been achieved.   27  There are minor costs and benefits related to the first five comparison criteria as indicated by the light green shading (green indicates a potential benefit). As indicated above the two criteria where the difference between the traceability system is biggest is �Speed and efficiency� which strongly favour a traditional system and �Interoperability� which strongly favour a blockchain-based system. When deciding between a traditional implementation of an electronic traceability system and a blockchain-based one it is important to determine which system qualities are most important. If database transparency integrity and robustness is important then a blockchain solution can be very relevant. On the other hand if speed and data confidentiality are considered to be the most important system attributes a traditional electronic traceability system is probably better. The relevance and utility of improved interoperability should not be underestimated. While interoperability is technically possible for traditional traceability systems it is difficult to get a large and diverse group of companies to agree on what standards and data formats to use. It is probably easier to get a large and diverse group of companies to agree to all use blockchain-based systems and then significantly improved interoperability will be a much-desired side effect of that decision. 6.2 Red meat supply chain example The food industry is generally vulnerable to crime and of the most vulnerable sectors within this industry are the meat fish olive oil and spice industries (Silvis et al. 2017). The European Horsemeat Scandal of 2013 highlighted vulnerabilities within the beef supply chain. This scandal resulted in product recalls serious effects on the sale of ground beef and huge economic losses for defrauded companies. Widespread media coverage of the event contributed to further damage to consumer trust and brought into question the integrity of the beef supply chain. Such scandals have increased awareness of food fraud causing it to become a major concern for the food industry its products reputation and consumers. According to recent research in the UK beef supply chain (Figure 5) in the period 1997�2017 counterfeiting2 and adulteration3 were the biggest threats. In the same supply chain primary processing secondary processing and rearing were the most vulnerable areas. The greatest proportion of incidents occurred during primary processing which will go on to affect subsequent parts of the beef supply chain. The greatest range of fraud types occurred in secondary processing and rearing had the third most recoded incidents.  2 All aspects of the fraudulent product and packaging are fully replicated including property infringement copies of popular food produced without the same food safety assurances (e.g. health certificates or documentation are be fraudulent missing or otherwise improper; product is produced without inspection and/or legal testing such as for Bovine spongiform This includes illegal slaughter of livestock). 3 A component of the finished product is fraudulent (e.g. presence of illegal veterinary medicine antibiotics or growth promoters; addition of an undeclared material for economic gain; undeclared substances to improve appearance or shelflife of product (i.e. colorants)).  28    Figure 5 An example of a UK beef supply chain (Brooks et al. 2017).   29  In general the pros and cons of using a blockchain-based traceability system for red meat are the same as for food products in general. While supply chains for red meat are quite diverse they do tend to have some characteristics in common mainly related to the type of commodity we are dealing. Examples of such characteristics and what influence they might have on the choice of traceability system is indicated in Table 8.  Table 8 Particular costs and benefits of blockchain-based systems in the supply chain for red meat  Characteristic of the red meat supply chain Relevance of blockchain-based implementation Animals used for red meat production are often uniquely identified and may be accompanied by a �passport� containing key data elements Whatever the traceability system there is no guarantee that the stated identifier is the actual identifier or that the stated passport is the actual passport for the animal in question. However in blockchain-based systems the integrity of the information once it has been recorded is assured which is not the case for a traditional traceability system. Animals used for red meat production are often linked with veterinary certificates that are meant to follow the associated red meat products as they move along the chain Falsification of veterinary certificates is a common type of fraud as is the practice of re-using / copying �good� certificates to replace �bad� or missing certificates. In a blockchain-based system data on the certificate cannot be modified once entered and re-use of certificates would be discovered in interoperable systems where a certificate ID exists and data is exchanged. While there are many food products with red meat ingredients (pies pizzas etc.) red meat is often the main product that the consumer buys Bigger TRUs means fewer TRUs and more valuable TRUs where the transactions that produced them can be traced individually; this would fit well with a blockchain-based system which in this case could also provide consumer access to the recordings in the database should that level of transparency be desired The portion of red meat that in the end reaches the consumer is big enough to identify and trace in practice should this be required  Veterinary certificates and laboratory reports are already being recorded in blockchain databases even if the traceability systems in the associated supply chains are not blockchain-based. This protects against physical tampering of the certificate or report in question as subsequent references to the certificate or report is required to link to the original recorded data which in a blockchain database cannot be overwritten. This is useful if the provider of the certificate or report is honest and supports transparency; to protect against the certificates being used in a dishonest manner later on in the supply chain. As this type of implementation can be done and be useful on its own it is likely to be (and to some degree it already is) one of the first successful applications of blockchain technology in the food industry.   30  6.3 Herbs and spices supply chain example    Figure 6 Supply chain examples for herbs and spices (Sz�k�cs et al. 2018) (Sharangi and Pandit 2018) (courtesy of British Pepper & Spice Co. Ltd. 2018)  31  Spices and herbs which are consumed in small quantities but used in a wide range of foods and food products represent a unique segment within the food sector which is associated with very complex distribution product chains. As such specific concerns regarding food safety apply to these particular commodities (Sz�k�cs et al. 2018). In general herbs and spices represent an attractive category for potential offenders because the products have a high value by weight and consumers have a limited capacity to detect adulteration (Silvis et al. 2017). Common authenticity issues associated with spices are the addition of lower value product foreign and product own material which may include addition of unapproved �enhancements� such as dyes to cover up the extension. Ground spices are particularly prone to adulteration because the milling or grinding step changes the shape of both the spice and adulterant to a powder which makes it difficult to detect adulterants in the final product (Silvis et al. 2017). A model of spices and herbs supply chain is exemplified in Figure 6. In general the pros and cons of using a blockchain-based traceability system for herbs and spices are the same as for food products in general. While supply chains for herbs and spices are quite diverse they do tend to have some characteristics in common mainly related to the type of commodity we are dealing. Examples of such characteristics and what influence they might have on the choice of traceability system is indicated in Table 9. Table 9 Costs and benefits of blockchain-based systems in the supply chain for herbs and spices Characteristic of the herbs and spices supply chain Relevance of blockchain-based implementation Production planning for herbs and spices may be difficult; some crops are wild Traditionally initial data capture is more problematic for wild crops and wild captured fish; a blockchain database is more useful if the integrity of the initially recorded data can be assured The herbs and spices supply chain is generally fairly long with many intermediaries Longer chains mean interoperability is a big problem and a central database system is not feasible; an argument for blockchain-based systems Herbs and spices are often supplied by developing countries Most blockchain implementations are technologically more advanced than the traditional systems and would require infrastructure processing capacity online connection etc.; it might be difficult to support a blockchain application in these situations Herbs and spices are generally bulk products and at some stages in the supply chain it is difficult to assign a physical identifier to the TRU This is a challenge for both types of traceability systems and it might be that the transactions cannot be recorded directly which perhaps is a bigger problem in a blockchain-based system which is not designed to deal with data that we only know the current state of For the final consumer herbs and spices are often ingredients and not the main product they buy For complex products with multiple ingredients traceability is a challenge regardless of what type of system is used. However blockchain systems have the additional challenge of requiring all transformations to be recorded; that is not always feasible for complex products. Also recording the large number of transformations involved in making a complex product will be more problematic in a blockchain-based system because of the data duplication and the corresponding speed penalty.  As indicated the main advantage of blockchain-based traceability systems is the improved interoperability that is so problematic in traditional traceability systems. This argument holds for all food commodities and improved interoperability is probably the most immediate benefit if one chooses a blockchain-based system (or rather a set of blockchain-based systems that exchange data). With that said the pros and cons of using a blockchain-based traceability system rather than a traditional one varies slightly with the commodity type as indicated in the two examples above. A blockchain-based system is most suitable when there are clearly defined and identified TRUs when  32  these TRUs are of a size and value that makes it relevant to keep track of all the transactions that led to that TRU and when the quality of the initial data capture is high and easy to validate. Blockchain implementations deal slightly less well with bulk products with products where the transactions are not recorded explicitly or where the data is fuzzy. It is not that the blockchain system cannot handle these issues; it is more that the benefits one would normally get from a blockchain-based implementation are not as clear. 6.4 How authorities may use data recorded in a blockchain-enabled system The costs associated with implementing and maintaining a blockchain-based traceability system largely fall on the food businesses; this includes the additional costs associated with a blockchain-based system as compared with a traditional system. Some of the benefits associated with a blockchainbased system are significant for the authorities as indicated in Table 10. Table 10 Costs and benefits of blockchain-based systems for authorities Comparison criteria Traditional electronic traceability system Electronic traceability system based on blockchain technology Suitability of database Authorities can only access claims in relation to state of variables Authorities can access the entire set of transformations that led to the current state which makes it easier to see the origin of the stated claim Data quality and veracity Authorities need separate and external checks to test the data quality and veracity Some degree of quality and veracity is provided by the blockchain-based system itself Immutability integrity and transparency It is difficult for authorities to know if recorded data has been subsequently overwritten The immutability of the database means that the authorities know that the data has not been overwritten Confidentiality Not an issue for authorities Trust Not really an issue for authorities (except for trust in data quality and veracity which is better in a blockchain-based system) Robustness Not an issue for authorities Speed and efficiency Not an issue for authorities Interoperability Lack of interoperability makes it more difficult to identify discrepancies and to do mass-balance accounting which is sometimes necessary to identify fraud Better interoperability and better access to comparable data from different systems makes it easier to identify discrepancies and to do massbalance accounting  As indicated the costs associated with blockchain-based systems (speed efficiency and confidentiality in particular) are not particularly relevant for authorities whereas some of the benefits (recording of transactions and not only variable states immutable database interoperable systems) are significant for authorities. From this follows that authorities should be proponents of blockchain-based food traceability systems and should encourage FBOs to adopt them.  33  7 Conclusions and recommendations The overall recommendation is that unless confidentiality or speed are of paramount importance to base an electronic food traceability system on blockchain technology is a good solution. The main reason for this fairly clear conclusion is the question of interoperability and data sharing. While it is technically possible to achieve this between existing systems in practice lack of interoperability has been one of the main bottlenecks preventing data access from farm to fork. Rather than continuing to hope for the widespread adoption of standards to support interoperability it is probably more realistic to hope that many actors in the supply chain will adopt blockchain-based traceability systems which in itself will increase interoperability. It is worth emphasising that blockchain-based implementations will not solve all or even most of the problems associated with traditional electronic traceability systems. This includes: � Data quality and veracity � still a problem in blockchain-based implementations. � Food fraud � still a challenge in blockchain-based implementation although if food fraud is detected it will be easier to identify who made the fraudulent statement. � Need for standards � while standards for EDI are less relevant when using blockchain-based systems standards that define what the recorded data elements and values mean (ontologies) will be needed more than ever. The increased interoperability will mean increased access to data recorded in a different part of the supply chain; a standard is needed to define what the data element names mean and what the recorded values signify. To avoid future disappointment it is important that both food businesses and solution providers are aware that these challenges will continue to exist also in blockchain-based implementations and in particular that the latter group tone down the current overselling of the technology and stops pretending that it is a panacea that will fix all our problems in this area.   34  8 References Abeyratne S.A. & R.P.
